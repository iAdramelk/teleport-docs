version: "15.x"

Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with database access:

- Enable users to retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](/docs/access-controls/access-requests) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

## Demo

Let's connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and pgAdmin 4 after authenticating
with GitHub, execute a few SQL queries and observe them in the audit log:
