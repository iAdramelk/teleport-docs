title: MongoDB Automatic User Provisioning 
description: Configure automatic user provisioning for MongoDB.

Teleport can automatically create users in your database, removing the need for
creating individual user accounts in advance or using the same set of shared
database accounts for all users.

- Teleport cluster v14.3 or above.
- A self-hosted MongoDB database enrolled with your Teleport cluster. Follow
  the [Teleport documentation](/docs/database-access/guides/mongodb-self-hosted) to learn how
  to enroll your database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

  Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with MongoDB Atlas.

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

Teleport uses the same authentication mechanism (X.509) when connecting as an
admin user as for regular user connections.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
connections.

First create a role on `admin` database with the following privileges:

```bash
db.getSiblingDB("admin").runCommand({
    createRole: "teleport-admin-role",
    privileges: [
        { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "inprog" ] },
        { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "grantRole", "revokeRole" ] },
        { resource: { db: "$external", "collection": "" }, actions: [ "createUser", "updateUser", "dropUser", "viewUser", "setAuthenticationRestriction", "changeCustomData"] },
    ],
    roles: [],
})
```

<Accordion title="Limit the grantRole action to specific databases">
  In the above example, the `grantRole` privilege is granted to the admin user
  for all databases in order for the admin user to assign roles from all
  databases, including the `admin` database.

  To enforce the principle of least privilege, you can limit the `grantRole` to
  only the databases that own the roles to be assigned to the auto-provisioned
  users:

  ```bash
  db.getSiblingDB("admin").runCommand({
      createRole: "teleport-admin-role",
      privileges: [
          { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "inprog" ] },
          { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "revokeRole" ] },
          { resource: { db: "$external", "collection": "" }, actions: [ "createUser", "updateUser", "dropUser", "viewUser", "setAuthenticationRestriction", "changeCustomData"] },
          { resource: { db: "<db1>", collection: "" }, actions: [ "grantRole" ] },
          { resource: { db: "<db2>", collection: "" }, actions: [ "grantRole" ] },
          ...
      ],
      roles: [],
  })
  ```
</Accordion>

Now create the admin user with this role:

```bash
db.getSiblingDB("$external").runCommand({
  createUser: "CN=teleport-admin",
  roles: [ { role: 'teleport-admin-role', db: 'admin' } ],
})
```

Next, configure the database admin user in the Teleport database configuration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static config">
    ```yaml
    db_service:
      enabled: "yes"
      databases:
      - name: "example"
        protocol: "mongodb"
        uri: "localhost:27017"
        admin_user:
          name: "teleport-admin"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dynamic resource">
    ```yaml
    kind: db
    version: v3
    metadata:
      name: example
    spec:
      protocol: "mongodb"
      uri: "localhost:27017"
      admin_user:
        name: "teleport-admin"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

To specify the database roles a user should be assigned within the database,
use the `db_roles` role option:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: auto-db-users
spec:
  options:
    # create_db_user_mode enables automatic user provisioning for matching databases
    create_db_user_mode: keep
  allow:
    db_labels:
      "*": "*"
    db_names:
    - "*"
    # db_roles is a list of roles the database user will be assigned
    db_roles:
    - "readAnyDatabase@admin"
    - "readWrite@db1"
    - "myCustomRole@db2"
    - "{{internal.db_roles}}"
    - "{{external.db_roles}}"
```

With automatic user provisioning, users always connect to the database with
their Teleport username so the `db_users` role field is ignored for roles
that have database user provisioning enabled.

The available provisioning modes are:

- `off`: Disables user provisioning.

- `keep`: Enables user provisioning and disables users at session end. The user
  will be stripped of all roles and the user account will be locked.

- `best_effort_drop`: Enables user provisioning and, when the session ends,
  drops the user if no resources depend on it. In cases where any resource
  depends on the user, it falls back to disabling the user, mirroring the
  behavior of `keep` mode.

Users created within the database will:

- Have the same username as the authenticated Teleport user.
- Have `teleport-auto-user` set to `true` in the user's `customData`.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

Now, log into your Teleport cluster and connect to the database:

```bash
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com
$ tsh db connect --db-name <database> example
```

<Note>
  <p>
    **Database Username**
  </p>

  When connecting to a database with user provisioning enabled, the Database
  Service expects your Teleport username will be used as the database username .

  If using a GUI database client like MongoDB Compass, make sure to use your Teleport
  username as the database username. `tsh db connect` will default to your
  Teleport username automatically when connecting to a database with user
  provisioning enabled.

  When connecting to a leaf cluster database with user provisioning enabled, the
  Database Service expects the database username to be
  `remote-<your-teleport-username>-<root-cluster-name>`.
</Note>

To view the list of database roles that are allowed for each database, you can
use the command `tsh db ls -v`. By default, all database roles will be assigned
to your auto-provisioned database user. You can optionally select a subset of
the database roles with `--db-roles`:

```bash
$ tsh db connect --db-name <database> --db-roles myCustomRole@db2 example
```

## Troubleshooting

### Use your mapped remote username error

You may encounter the following error when connecting to a database in a remote
cluster:

```shell
> tsh db connect --db-name <database> example
ERROR: please use your mapped remote username ("remote-<your-teleport-username>-<root-cluster-name>") to connect instead of "<database-user>"
```

When you access resources in a remote cluster, the remote cluster will receive
the name `remote-<your-teleport-username>-<root-cluster-name>` from the local
cluster. This is to prevent any naming collisions with users in the remote
cluster. Please use the username from the error message as the database
username for when connecting through `tsh` or GUI clients.
