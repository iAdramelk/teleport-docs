title: AWS Redshift Automatic User Provisioning 
description: Configure automatic user provisioning for AWS Redshift.
version: "15.x"

Teleport can automatically create users in your database, removing the need for
creating individual user accounts in advance or using the same set of shared
database accounts for all users.

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster v14.1.3 or higher with a configured [AWS
  Redshift](/docs/database-access/guides/postgres-redshift) database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

<Note>
  <p>
    **Supported services**
  </p>

  Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with Redshift Serverless.
</Note>

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

Teleport uses the same authentication mechanism (IAM authentication) when
connecting as an admin user as for regular user connections.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
processes and role assignments:

```
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" WITH PASSWORD DISABLE;
GRANT ROLE "sys:superuser" TO "teleport-admin";
```

Users created by Teleport will be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role in the
database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Next, configure the database admin user in the Teleport database configuration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static config">
    ```yaml
    db_service:
      enabled: "yes"
      databases:
      - name: "example"
        protocol: "postgres"
        uri: "redshift-cluster-1.abcdefghijklm.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439"
        admin_user:
          name: "teleport-admin"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dynamic resource">
    ```yaml
    kind: db
    version: v3
    metadata:
      name: example
    spec:
      protocol: "postgres"
      uri: "redshift-cluster-1.abcdefghijklm.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439"
      admin_user:
        name: "teleport-admin"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  <p>
    **Auto-discovered databases**
  </p>

  For auto-discovered cloud databases, the name of the admin user is taken from
  the `teleport.dev/db-admin` label.
</Tip>

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

To specify the database roles a user should be assigned within the database,
use the `db_roles` role option:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: auto-db-users
spec:
  options:
    # create_db_user_mode enables automatic user provisioning for matching databases
    create_db_user_mode: keep
  allow:
    db_labels:
      "*": "*"
    db_names:
    - "*"
    # db_roles is a list of roles the database user will be assigned
    db_roles:
    - reader
    - "{{internal.db_roles}}"
    - "{{external.db_roles}}"
```

With automatic user provisioning, users always connect to the database with
their Teleport username so the `db_users` role field is ignored for roles
that have database user provisioning enabled.

The available provisioning modes are:

- `off`: Disables user provisioning.

- `keep`: Enables user provisioning and disables users at session end. The user
  will be stripped of all roles and the user account will be locked.

- `best_effort_drop`: Enables user provisioning and, when the session ends,
  drops the user if no resources depend on it. In cases where any resource
  depends on the user, it falls back to disabling the user, mirroring the
  behavior of `keep` mode.

Users created within the database will:

- Have the same username as the authenticated Teleport user.
- Be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database.

Note that in case of a name conflict where a user with the same name already
exists in the database and is not managed by Teleport (i.e. not assigned the
`teleport-auto-user` role), the connection will be aborted.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

Now, log into your Teleport cluster and connect to the database:

```bash
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com
$ tsh db connect --db-name <database> example
```

<Note>
  <p>
    **Database Username**
  </p>

  When connecting to a database with user provisioning enabled, the Database
  Service expects your Teleport username will be used as the database username .

  If using a GUI database client like pgAdmin, make sure to use your Teleport
  username as the database username. `tsh db connect` will default to your
  Teleport username automatically when connecting to a database with user
  provisioning enabled.

  When connecting to a leaf cluster database with user provisioning enabled, the
  Database Service expects the database username to be
  `remote-<your-teleport-username>-<root-cluster-name>`.
</Note>

To view the list of database roles that are allowed for each database, you can
use the command `tsh db ls -v`. By default, all database roles will be assigned
to your auto-provisioned database user. You can optionally select a subset of
the database roles with `--db-roles`:

```bash
$ tsh db connect --db-name <database> --db-roles reader example
```

## Troubleshooting

### Use your mapped remote username error

You may encounter the following error when connecting to a database in a remote
cluster:

```shell
> tsh db connect --db-name <database> example
ERROR: please use your mapped remote username ("remote-<your-teleport-username>-<root-cluster-name>") to connect instead of "<database-user>"
```

When you access resources in a remote cluster, the remote cluster will receive
the name `remote-<your-teleport-username>-<root-cluster-name>` from the local
cluster. This is to prevent any naming collisions with users in the remote
cluster. Please use the username from the error message as the database
username for when connecting through `tsh` or GUI clients.

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database client](/docs/connect-your-client/gui-clients).
- Learn about [role templating](/docs/access-controls/guides/role-templates#interpolation-rules).
- Read automatic user provisioning [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
