These guides cover configuring access control policies for database users.

Read the [RBAC](/docs/database-access/rbac/configuring-access) guide to get a general understanding
of how to configure Teleport roles to grant or deny access to your database users.

The [Automatic User Provisioning](/docs/database-access/auto-user-provisioning) guides explain
how to get Teleport to create database user accounts on demand for MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and more.
