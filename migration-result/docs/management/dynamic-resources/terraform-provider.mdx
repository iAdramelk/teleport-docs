  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- [Terraform >= 1.0.0+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v1.0.0
  ```

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  15.0.2
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.

## Step 1/3. Create Teleport credentials for Terraform

Terraform needs a signed identity file from the Teleport cluster certificate
authority to manage resources in the cluster.
You can create a local Teleport user for this purpose or you can use the machine identity agent
[(Machine ID)](/docs/machine-id/introduction) to generate credentials.

If you intend to run Terraform from a CI/CD platform, Machine ID is often a better
option for generating credentials. Machine ID can provision ephemeral short-lived
certificates that are appropriate for CI/CD workflows instead of using manually-generated
credentials that have a longer time-to-live (TTL) period. For more information about
using Machine ID, see the [Machine ID Getting Started Guide](/docs/machine-id/getting-started).

To prepare credentials for a local Teleport user:

1. Create a folder called `teleport-terraform` to hold temporary files:

   ```code
   $ mkdir -p teleport-terraform
   $ cd teleport-terraform
   ```

2. Create a new file called `terraform.yaml` and open it in an editor.

3. Configure settings for a local Teleport user and role by pasting the following content into the `terraform.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: terraform
   spec:
     allow:
       db_labels:
         '*': '*'
       app_labels:
         '*': '*'
       rules:
         - resources:
           - app
           - cluster_auth_preference
           - cluster_networking_config
           - db
           - device
           - github
           - login_rule
           - oidc
           - okta_import_rule
           - role
           - saml
           - session_recording_config
           - token
           - trusted_cluster
           - user
           - access_list
           verbs: ['list','create','read','update','delete']
   version: v7
   ---
   kind: user
   metadata:
     name: terraform
   spec:
     roles: ['terraform']
   version: v2
   ```

   These settings configure a user and role named `terraform` with the permissions
   required to manage resources in your Teleport cluster.

4. Create the `terraform` user and role by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f terraform.yaml
   role 'terraform' has been created
   user "terraform" has been created
   ```

   The `terraform` user can't sign in to get credentials, so you must have another user
   **impersonate** the `terraform` account to request a certificate.

5. Create a new file called `terraform-impersonator.yaml` and open it in an editor.

6. Configure a role that enables your user to impersonate the Terraform user by pasting
   the following content into the `terraform-impersonator.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   version: v7
   metadata:
     name: terraform-impersonator
   spec:
     allow:
       # This impersonate role allows any user assigned to this role to impersonate
       # and generate certificates for the user named "terraform" with a role also
       # named "terraform".
       impersonate:
         users: ['terraform']
         roles: ['terraform']
   ```

7. Create the `terraform-impersonator` role by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f terraform-impersonator.yaml
   role 'terraform-impersonator' has been created
   ```

8. Assign the `terraform-impersonator` role to your Teleport user by running the appropriate
   commands for your authentication provider:
   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="Local User">
       1. Retrieve your local user's roles as a comma-separated list:

          ```code
          $ ROLES=$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.roles | join(",")')
          ```

       2. Edit your local user to add the new role:

          ```code
          $ tctl users update $(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') \
            --set-roles "${ROLES?},terraform-impersonator"
          ```

       3. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="GitHub">
       1. Retrieve your `github` authentication connector:

          ```code
          $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
          ```

          Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
          to the `github.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
          github.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

       2. Edit `github.yaml`, adding `terraform-impersonator` to the `teams_to_roles` section.

          The team you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
          organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the team must include your user account and
          should be the smallest team possible within your organization.

          Here is an example:

          ```diff
            teams_to_roles:
              - organization: octocats
                team: admins
                roles:
                  - access
          +       - terraform-impersonator
          ```

       3. Apply your changes:

          ```code
          $ tctl create -f github.yaml
          ```

       4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="SAML">
       1. Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

          ```code
          $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
          ```

          Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
          to the `saml.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
          saml.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

       2. Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `terraform-impersonator` to the `attributes_to_roles` section.

          The attribute you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
          organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your
          user account and should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

          Here is an example:

          ```diff
            attributes_to_roles:
              - name: "groups"
                value: "my-group"
                roles:
                  - access
          +       - terraform-impersonator
          ```

       3. Apply your changes:

          ```code
          $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
          ```

       4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="OIDC">
       1. Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

          ```code
          $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
          ```

          Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
          to the `oidc.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
          oidc.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

       2. Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `terraform-impersonator` to the `claims_to_roles` section.

          The claim you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your organization's
          role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your user account and
          should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

          Here is an example:

          ```diff
            claims_to_roles:
              - name: "groups"
                value: "my-group"
                roles:
                  - access
          +       - terraform-impersonator
          ```

       3. Apply your changes:

          ```code
          $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
          ```

       4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>

9. Request a signed identity file for the Terraform user by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth sign --user=terraform --out=terraform-identity
   ```

   After running this command, you have a `terraform-identity` file with credentials for the Terraform user.

## Step 2/3. Prepare a Terraform configuration file

To prepare a Terraform configuration file:

1. Create a new file called `provider.tf` and open it in an editor.

2. Use the Teleport Terraform provider and connect it to your Teleport cluster
   by pasting the following content into the `provider.tf` file:

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="Cloud-Hosted">
       ```hcl
       terraform {
         required_providers {
           teleport = {
             source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
             version = "~> 15.0"
           }
         }
       }

       provider "teleport" {
         # Update addr to point to your Teleport Cloud tenant URL's host:port
         addr               = "mytenant.teleport.sh:443"
         identity_file_path = "terraform-identity"
       }

       # creates a test role, if we don't declare resources, Terraform won't try to
       # connect to Teleport and we won't be able to validate the setup.
       resource "teleport_role" "test" {
         version = "v7"
         metadata = {
           name        = "test"
           description = "Dummy role to validate Terraform Provider setup"
           labels = {
             test = "yes"
           }
         }

         spec = {
         }
       }

       ```
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
       ```hcl
       terraform {
         required_providers {
           teleport = {
             source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
             version = "~> 15.0"
           }
         }
       }

       provider "teleport" {
         # Update addr to point to Teleport Auth/Proxy
         # addr              = "auth.example.com:3025"
         addr               = "proxy.example.com:443"
         identity_file_path = "terraform-identity"
       }

       # creates a test role, if we don't declare resources, Terraform won't try to
       # connect to Teleport and we won't be able to validate the setup.
       resource "teleport_role" "test" {
         version = "v7"
         metadata = {
           name        = "test"
           description = "Dummy role to validate Terraform Provider setup"
           labels = {
             test = "yes"
           }
         }

         spec = {
         }
       }

       ```
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Validate the configuration

To apply the configuration:

1. Check the contents of the `teleport-terraform` folder:

   ```code
   $ ls
   # provider.tf  terraform-identity  terraform-impersonator.yaml  terraform.yaml
   ```

2. Initialize the working directory that contains Terraform configuration files
   by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ terraform init
   ```

3. Execute the Terraform plan defined in the configuration file by running the
   following command:

   ```code
   $ terraform apply
   ```
