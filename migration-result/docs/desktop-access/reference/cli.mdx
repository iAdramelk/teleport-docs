The following `tctl` commands are used to manage the Teleport Windows Desktop
Service.

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  15.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.

Generate a join token for a Windows Desktop Service:

```sh
$ tctl tokens add --type=WindowsDesktop
```

List registered Windows Desktop Services:

```sh
$ tctl get windows_desktop_service
```

List registered Windows desktops:

```sh
$ tctl get windows_desktop
```
