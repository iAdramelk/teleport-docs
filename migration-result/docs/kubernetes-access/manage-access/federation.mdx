title: Federated Kubernetes Access with Trusted Clusters
description: Federated Access using Teleport trusted clusters.
version: "15.x"

There are cases when you have Kubernetes clusters that have to operate independently,
for example, they are part of a different organization or have intermittent connectivity.

You can take advantage of [trusted clusters](/docs/management/admin/trustedclusters)
to federate trust across Kubernetes clusters.

    When multiple trusted clusters are present behind the Teleport Proxy Service, the
    `kubeconfig` generated by [tsh login](/docs/reference/cli/tsh#tsh-login) contains the
    Kubernetes API endpoint determined by the `<cluster>` argument to [tsh
    login](/docs/reference/cli/tsh#tsh-login).

    For example, consider the following scenario:

    - There are three Teleport/Kubernetes clusters: the root cluster named `main` and the leaf clusters
      named `east` and `west` in the `cluster_name` setting for each cluster.
    - The clusters `east` and `west` trust the `main` root cluster certificate authority.
    - Users always authenticate against `main` but use their certificates to access
      SSH nodes and the Kubernetes API in all three clusters.
    - The DNS name of the root cluster Teleport Proxy Service is `main.example.com`.

    In this scenario, users usually log in using the following command:

    ```bash
    # Using login without arguments
    $ tsh --proxy=main.example.com login

    # User's `kubeconfig` now contains one entry for the main Kubernetes
    # endpoint, i.e. `main.example.com`.

    # Receive a certificate for "east":
    $ tsh --proxy=main.example.com login east

    # User's `kubeconfig` now contains the entry for the "east" Kubernetes
    # endpoint, i.e. `east.main.example.com`.
    ```

    For example, consider the following scenario:

    - There are two Teleport/Kubernetes clusters named `east` and `west`.
      Each cluster has its own configuration file with its name specified in the
      `cluster_name` field.
    - The clusters `east` and `west` are leaf clusters that trust a Teleport Team
      or Enterprise Cloud account, for example, `mytenant.teleport.sh`.
    - Users always authenticate against `mytenant.teleport.sh` but use their certificates to access
      SSH nodes and the Kubernetes API in all three clusters.

    In this scenario, users usually log in using the following command:

    ```bash
    # Using login without arguments
    $ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh login

    # User's `kubeconfig` now contains one entry for the main Kubernetes
    # endpoint, i.e. `mytenant.teleport.sh`.

    # Receive a certificate for "east":
    $ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh login east

    # User's `kubeconfig` now contains the entry for the "east" Kubernetes
    # endpoint, i.e. `east.mytenant.teleport.sh`.
