title: Join Services with GCP
description: Use the GCP join method to add services to your Teleport cluster.
version: '14.x'
---

This guide will explain how to use the **GCP join method** to configure Teleport
processes to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets when they
are running in a GCP VM.

The GCP join method is available to any Teleport process running on a GCP VM.
The VM must have a
[service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances)
assigned to it (the default service account is fine). No IAM roles are required
on the Teleport process joining the cluster.

    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- A GCP VM to host a Teleport service, with a service account assigned to it
  and with the Teleport binary installed.
- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  {/* Ignoring scope linting since we use this partial throughout the docs and
  cannot guarantee that it will line up with a page's configured scopes*/}
  {/*lint ignore scopes*/}
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  14.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  {/*lint ignore scopes*/}
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/3. Create the GCP joining token

Configure your Teleport Auth Service with a special dynamic token which will
allow services from your GCP projects to join your Teleport cluster.

Under the hood, services will prove that they are running in your GCP project
by sending a signed ID token which matches an allow rule configured in your GCP
joining token.

Create the following `token.yaml` file with a `gcp.allow` rule specifying your GCP
project ID(s), service account(s), and location(s) in which your GCP instances
will run:

```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your GCP project to use this token
  name: gcp-token
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required (e.g. Node, Proxy, App, Kube, DB, WindowsDesktop)
  roles: [Node]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: gcp

  gcp:
    allow:
      # The GCP project ID(s) that VMs can join from.
      - project_ids: ["example-project-id"]
        # (Optional) The locations that VMs can join from. Note: both regions and
        # zones are accepted.
        locations: ["us-west1", "us-west2-a"]
        # (Optional) The email addresses of service accounts that VMs can join
        # with.
        service_accounts: ["example@example.com"]
```

Run the following command to create the token:

```code
$ tctl create token.yaml
```

## Step 2/3. Configure your services

The GCP join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH (`Node`), Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, Database, or Windows Desktop Services. The Teleport
process should be run directly on a GCP VM.

Configure your Teleport process with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 1
and `method: gcp` as shown in the following example config:

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: gcp-token
    method: gcp
  proxy_server: https://teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```

## Step 3/3. Launch your Teleport process

Configure your Teleport instance to start automatically when the host boots up by
creating a systemd service for it. The instructions depend on how you installed
your Teleport instance.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Package Manager">
    On the host where you will run your Teleport instance, enable and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TAR Archive">
    On the host where you will run your Teleport instance, create a systemd service
    configuration for Teleport, enable the Teleport service, and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of your Teleport instance with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

Once you have started Teleport, confirm that your service is able to connect to
and join your cluster.
