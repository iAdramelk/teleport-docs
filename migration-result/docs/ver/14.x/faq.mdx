## Can I use Teleport in production today?

Teleport has been deployed on server clusters with thousands of hosts at
Fortune 500 companies. It has been through several security audits from
nationally recognized technology security companies, so we are comfortable with
the stability of Teleport from a security perspective.

## Can Teleport be deployed in agentless mode?

Yes. All Teleport services support agentless mode, where the service proxies
traffic to an upstream infrastructure resource not available on `localhost`.

With Teleport in agentless mode, you can easily control access to SSH servers,
Kubernetes clusters, desktops, databases, and internal applications without
running any additional software on your servers. Agentless mode supports session
recordings and audit logs for deep understanding into user behavior.

For capabilities such as kernel-level logging and user provisioning, we
recommend Teleport as a drop in replacement for OpenSSH. Since Teleport replaces
the OpenSSH agent while preserving OpenSSH's functionality, you get more
functionality without a net addition of an agent on your system.

## Can I use OpenSSH with a Teleport cluster?

Yes, this question comes up often and is related to the previous one. Take a
look at [Using OpenSSH Guide](/docs/ver/14.x/server-access/guides/openssh).

## Can I connect to nodes behind a firewall?

Yes, Teleport supports reverse SSH tunnels out of the box. To configure
behind-firewall clusters, see [Configure Trusted Clusters](/docs/ver/14.x/management/admin/trustedclusters).

## Should we use Teleport Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition for connecting resources to our Teleport cluster?

Teleport Team, Enterprise, and Enterprise Cloud customers should use the Enterprise release of the
`teleport` binary for agents. Running the Community Edition binary could result in
incompatibility to these cluster editions for certain features.

To verify you have a Teleport Enterprise release installed run the `teleport version`
command and Enterprise will be in the output.

```bash
$ teleport version
# Teleport Enterprise v14.3.6 go1.21
```

Teleport Community Edition clusters should use the Teleport Community Edition releases. The `teleport version`
command will only include Teleport in its output for those releases.

```bash
$ teleport version
# Teleport v14.3.6 go1.21
```

See the [Installation](/docs/ver/14.x/installation) guide for details on installing to specific platforms
with Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition releases.

## Can individual agents create reverse tunnels to the Proxy Service without creating a new cluster?

Yes. When running a Teleport agent, use the `--auth-server` flag to point to the
Proxy Service address (this would be `public_addr` and `web_listen_addr` in your
file configuration). For more information, see
[Adding Nodes to the
Cluster](/docs/ver/14.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token).

## Can Nodes use a single port for reverse tunnels?

Yes, Teleport supports tunnel multiplexing on a single port. Set the
`tunnel_listen_addr` to use the same port as the `web_listen_addr` address
setting in the `proxy_service` configuration. Teleport will automatically use
multiplexing with that configuration.

## Can I copy files from one Teleport node to another?

Yes, Teleport supports [Headless WebAuthn authentication](/docs/ver/14.x/access-controls/guides/headless),
which allows you to perform operations like `tsh ssh` or `tsh scp` from remote systems where you
are not logged in to Teleport or may not have access to a browser.

## I'm getting `ssh: subsystem request failed` while I try to copy files, what to do?

Make sure that all Teleport components are at least at version 10.3.0. Older versions
don't support the SFTP protocol, and it's enabled by default in `tsh` v11.0.0 and OpenSSH v9.0.

## `tsh` is very slow on Windows, what to do?

If your host machine is joined to an Active Directory domain, you might find user lookups take a
lot longer than you expect. The number of Active Directory accounts that must be scanned to
perform a user lookup can cause tsh to hang waiting to get information about the current user.
To fix this issue, you can use environment variables to set default account information for your
Teleport user. If you are experiencing long lookup times on Windows, do the following:

- Make sure `tsh` is at least at version 12.2.4.
- Either set the `TELEPORT_USER` environment variable or set the `--user` flag to the name of your Teleport user.
- Either set the `TELEPORT_LOGIN` environment variable or set the `--login` flag to the name of current host user. This setting can be overridden if you open a new SSH session on a machine as a different user.
- Set the `TELEPORT_HOME` environment variable to be the home directory of your current host user + `\.tsh`. For example, if your home directory is `C:\Users\Me`, you'd set `TELEPORT_HOME` to `C:\Users\Me\.tsh`.

You can set these environment variables globally in Windows so that you don't have to set them every
time you run `tsh`.

## How is Open Source different from Enterprise?

Teleport provides four editions:

- Teleport Team
- Teleport Enterprise
- Teleport Enterprise Cloud
- Teleport Community Edition

Here is a detailed breakdown of the differences between Teleport's editions.

## Which version of Teleport is supported?

Teleport releases a new major version approximately every 4 months, and provides
security-critical support for the current and two previous major versions. With
our typical release cadence, we usually support each major version for 12
months.

### Supported versions

Here are the major versions of Teleport and their support windows:

| Release | Release Date       | EOL            | Minimum `tsh` version |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| v14.0   | September 20, 2023 | September 2024 | v13.0.0               |
| v13.0   | May 8, 2023        | May 2024       | v12.0.0               |
| v12.0   | February 6, 2023   | February 2024  | v11.0.0               |

### Version compatibility

Teleport uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version numbers
include a major version, minor version, and patch version, separated by dots.
When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
apply:

- **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
  component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
  with any 8.3.0 component.
- Servers support clients that are one major version behind, but do not support
  clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
  instance is compatible with 7.x.x agents and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
  guarantee that a 9.x.x agent will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service instance.
  This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
  You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
- Proxy Service instances and agents do not support Auth Service instances that
  are on an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Service
  instances by default. You can override version checks by passing
  `--skip-version-check` when starting agents and Proxy Service instances.

## Does the Web UI support copy and paste?

Yes. You can copy and paste using a mouse.

## What TCP ports does Teleport use?

Please refer to our [Networking](/docs/ver/14.x/reference/networking) guide.

## Does Teleport support authentication via OIDC, SAML, or Active Directory?

Teleport offers this feature for the [Enterprise Cloud](/docs/ver/14.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/introduction) and [Enterprise](/docs/ver/14.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) versions of Teleport.

## Why do I see an alert that some agents are out of date?

Teleport monitors the inventory of all cluster components and compares their
Teleport versions with the latest release on our GitHub page. If a component is
not on the latest release, Teleport will create a cluster alert encouraging
users to upgrade.

This check is performed against all cluster components, including the Proxy
Service and Auth Service, as well as agents running other Teleport Services.

## What is the minimum TLS version that Teleport requires?

Teleport requires a minimum of TLS version 1.2.

This means that when applications and clients establish or accept TLS connections with Teleport processes, they must use TLS 1.2 or a higher protocol version. Teleport enforces this requirement in all operations that involve TLS connections.

## Can I suppress warnings about available upgrades?

Yes. The `tctl alerts ack` command can be used to acknowledge an alert and
temporarily prevent it from being displayed to users. To acknowledge an alert,
you need its ID. You can get a listing of all alerts and their IDs with the
`tctl alerts list` command.

For detailed information on this family of commands, see the
[CLI Reference](/docs/ver/14.x/reference/cli/tctl#tctl-alerts-list).

## Does Teleport send any data back to the cloud?

The open source edition of Teleport does not send any information to our
company, and can be used on servers without internet access.

The commercial editions of Teleport can optionally be configured to send
anonymized information, depending on the license purchased. This information
contains the following:

- Teleport license identifier;
- anonymized cluster name and Teleport auth server host ID;
- for each Teleport user, the anonymized user name and a per-protocol count of
  interactions - Teleport logins, SSH and Kubernetes exec sessions, Application
  access web sessions and TCP connections, SSH port forwards, Kubernetes API
  requests, SFTP actions.

The anonymization is done by passing names and IDs through HMAC-SHA-256, with a
HMAC key that's randomly generated when the Teleport cluster is initialized for
the first time and is never shared with us; this makes it infeasible for anyone
without access to the cluster to deanonymize the data we store.

The code that aggregates and anonymizes this data can be found [in our
repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/lib/usagereporter/teleport/aggregating).

For more details, see the [Usage Reporting and Billing](/docs/ver/14.x/usage-billing)
guide.

editions of Teleport.

### Teleport Connect

When you first start the app, Teleport Connect asks for permission to collect and send telemetry data.
This includes tracking events such as:

- Logging in to a cluster
- Starting an SSH, database, or Kubernetes session
- File transfer during an SSH session
- Creating an Access Request
- Reviewing an Access Request
- Assuming an Access Request

On login, we also collect some device-related data:

- Operating system and its version
- App version
- Processor architecture

Additionally, we ask for a job role (answer is optional).

The full list of events and collected data is defined as [protocol buffer messages in the Teleport source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v14/proto/prehog/v1alpha/connect.proto).
We do not track the details of those events but merely that the given event took place. Each event includes the cluster
name and user name anonymized with HMAC using the cluster's internal random UUID as the key. It is infeasible to
associate this back to a specific cluster or user without access to the cluster's internal datastore.

If you no longer want to send usage data, see [disabling telemetry](/docs/ver/14.x/connect-your-client/teleport-connect#disabling-telemetry).
