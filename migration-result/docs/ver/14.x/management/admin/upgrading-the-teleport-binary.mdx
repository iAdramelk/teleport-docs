title: Upgrading the Teleport Binary
description: How to upgrade a teleport binary without sacrificing availability.
version: '14.x'
---

In this guide, we will show you how to upgrade the `teleport` binary on a Linux
host without sacrificing availability.

<Accordion title="Using containers?">
  If you are running `teleport` as a container, see
  [How to Run Teleport Using Docker](/docs/ver/14.x/installation#docker) for information on
  specifying a version.
</Accordion>

## Prerequisites

This guide requires a host where the `teleport` binary is running. The version
of the binary must be behind the latest.

For Teleport major version `14` the latest version is `14.0.0-dev`.
Compare this to the version of Teleport you have installed on the host:

```code
$ teleport version
Teleport v8.3.7 git:v8.3.7-0-ga8d066935 go1.17.3
```

## Step 1/3. Download a new Teleport binary

Preserve the old binary, just in case the upgrade goes wrong.

```code
$ DIR=$(which teleport | xargs dirname)
$ sudo mv ${DIR}/teleport ${DIR}/teleport.bak
```

Install the newest version of Teleport on the host:

Use the appropriate commands for your environment to install your package:

    ```

    <Accordion title="Is my Teleport instance compatible with Teleport Team?">
      Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides
      v13, read our compatibility rules to ensure that the
      binary is compatible with Teleport Cloud.

      When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
      apply:

      - **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
        component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
        with any 8.3.0 component.
      - Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
        clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
        is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
        guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
        This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
        You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
      - Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
        an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
        default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
        when starting Proxy Services and resource services.

    <Accordion title="Is my Teleport instance compatible with Teleport Enterprise Cloud?">
      Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides v13,
      read our compatibility rules to ensure that the binary is compatible with
      Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

      When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
      apply:

      - **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
        component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
        with any 8.3.0 component.
      - Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
        clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
        is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
        guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
        This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
        You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
      - Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on

        when starting Proxy Services and resource services.

## Step 2/3. Fork the `teleport` process

Fork a new `teleport` process by sending it the `USR2` signal:

```code
$ sudo kill -USR2 $(pidof teleport)
```

The original `teleport` process forked a new child process and passed existing file descriptors
to the child. You now have two processes handling requests on the same socket:

```code
$ pidof teleport
# 235276 235119
```

In our example, `235276` is a PID of the child process, and `235119` is a PID of the parent.

<Accordion title="Not sure which process is the parent?">
  You can use the following command, which prints the parent for each PID returned
  by `pidof`:

  ```code
  $ ps -o ppid= -p $(pidof teleport)
     1494
     1495
  ```
</Accordion>

In the logs you will see that the parent process reports that it has forked a new child
process, and the child accepts file descriptors from its parent.

```txt
2021-08-19T10:16:51-07:00 [PROC:1]  INFO Forked new child process. path:/usr/local/teleport service/signals.go:457
2021-08-19T10:16:51-07:00 [PROC:1]  INFO Using file descriptor diag 127.0.0.1:3434 passed by the parent process. service/signals.go:207
```

## Step 3/3. Return to a single `teleport` process

After forking the new `teleport` process, check the logs to ensure that the
process is running as expected. After that, you should either roll back or
complete the upgrade:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rollback">
    If the new binary behaves with errors, shut down the child process:

    ```code
    $ sudo kill -TERM 235276
    2022-04-20T15:33:58Z INFO [PROC:1]    Got signal "terminated", exiting immediately. service/signals.go:86
    2022-04-20T15:33:58Z WARN [PROC:1]    Forked teleport process 235276 has exited with status: 0. service/signals.go:506
    ```

    <Note>
      Do not forget to restore the original binary

      ```code
      $ sudo mv ${DIR}/teleport.bak ${DIR}/teleport
      ```
    </Note>

    You can retry the process again later.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Finish the upgrade">
    <Note>
      If you are upgrading a `teleport` daemon using an SSH connection established
      via Teleport, make sure to connect to the newly upgraded `teleport` process
      and shut down the previous `teleport` process from it.

      You can see which `teleport` process handles the connection by using
      `pstree`:

      ```code
      $ pstree -aps $$
      # systemd,1 splash
      #  └─systemd,6247 --user
      #      └─teleport-,235276
      #          └─bash,190718
      #              └─pstree,242371 -aps 190718
      ```
    </Note>

    Shut down the parent process gracefully using `SIGQUIT`:

    ```code
    $ sudo kill -QUIT 235119
    ```

    The parent process will log a graceful shutdown:

    ```txt
    2021-08-19T10:32:10-07:00 INFO [PROXY:SER] Shutting down gracefully. service/service.go:2952
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, all existing connections drain off and the parent will exit:

    ```code
    $ pidof teleport
    # 235276
    ```

    If for some reason, the parent process gets stuck (e.g., waiting for
    existing connections to finish), you can shut it down non-gracefully:

    ```code
    $ sudo kill -TERM 235119
    ```

    You are all set.
