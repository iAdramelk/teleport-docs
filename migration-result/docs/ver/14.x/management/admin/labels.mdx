title: Labels
description: Labeling Teleport resources
version: '14.x'
---

Teleport allows you to add arbitrary key-value pairs to applications, servers,
databases, and other resources in your cluster. You can use these to filter
resources when making queries via `tctl` and `tsh` as well as to limit the
resources that Teleport roles can access.

This guide explains how to add labels to Teleport resources.

There are two kinds of labels:

### Static labels

Static labels are hardcoded in a `teleport` daemon's configuration file and do
not change over time while the `teleport` process is running. An example of a static
label is a Node's environment, e.g., `staging` vs. `production`.

### Dynamic labels

Dynamic labels, also known as **label commands**, allow you to generate labels
at runtime. The `teleport` daemon will execute an external command on its host
at a configurable frequency and the output of the command becomes the label's
value.

This is especially useful for decoupling the label's value from your Teleport
configuration. For example, if you start Teleport on an Amazon EC2 instance, you
can set a `region` label based on a command that sends a request to the EC2
[instance metadata API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html).
This means that you can keep your configuration the same for each Node (and set
the configuration within an Amazon Machine Image) while enabling users to search for Nodes by AWS
region.

## Step 1/3. Prepare your Node

### Install Teleport on your Node

On the host where you will run your Teleport Node, follow the instructions for
your environment to install Teleport.

Use the appropriate commands for your environment to install your package:

    <Accordion title="Is my Teleport instance compatible with Teleport Team?">
      Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides
      v13, read our compatibility rules to ensure that the
      binary is compatible with Teleport Cloud.

      When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
      apply:

      - **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
        component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
        with any 8.3.0 component.
      - Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
        clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
        is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
        guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
        This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
        You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
      - Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
        an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
        default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
        when starting Proxy Services and resource services.

### Generate a token

On your local machine, use the `tctl` tool to generate an invite token that your
Node will use to join the cluster. In the following example, a new token is
created with a TTL of five minutes:

```code
# Generate a short-lived invitation token for a new node:
$ tctl tokens add --ttl=5m --type=node
# The invite token: abcd123-insecure-do-not-use-this

# You can also list all generated non-expired tokens:
$ tctl tokens ls
# Token                            Type            Expiry Time
# ------------------------         -----------     ---------------
# abcd123-insecure-do-not-use-this         Node            25 Sep 18 00:21 UTC
```

Copy the token. On the remote host that you will add to your Teleport cluster as a
Node, assign the token to an environment variable:

```code
$ export INVITE_TOKEN=<token>
```

We will use this in the next step.

## Step 2/3. Apply a static label to your Node

You can configure Node labels by editing Teleport's configuration file, then
starting Teleport.

On the host where you will run your Node, paste the following content into
`/etc/teleport.yaml` and adjust it for your environment:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # The address of your Auth Service.
  auth_server: tele.example.com:3025
  # Or, you can also use a Proxy Service
  # address, e.g., tele.example.com:443, if your Auth Service is not
  # exposed to the internet.
  proxy_server: tele.example.com:443

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  # Static labels are simple key/value pairs:
  labels:
    environment: dev
```

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # Your Teleport Cloud tenant address
  proxy_server: mytenant.teleport.sh:443

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  # Static labels are simple key/value pairs:
  labels:
    environment: dev
```

Next, start Teleport with the invite token you created earlier:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --token=${INVITE_TOKEN?}
```

Verify that you have added the label by running the following on your local
machine. Your Teleport user must be authorized to access the Node.

```code
$ tsh ls --query 'labels["environment"]=="dev"'
Node Name    Address    Labels
------------ ---------- ---------------
bdcb47b87ad6 ⟵ Tunnel environment=dev
```

<Accordion title="Don't see your Node?">
  First, check the logs for your Node to ensure the SSH Service is running. Your logs should resemble the following:

  ```text

  ```

  Next, ensure that your Teleport user has a login that corresponds to a user on
  your Node.

  Run the following command to get the current logins for your user:

  ```code
  $ tsh status
  > Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
    Logged in as:       myuser
    Cluster:            teleport.example.com
    Roles:              access, editor
    Logins:             -teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe
    Kubernetes:         enabled
    Valid until:        2022-04-27 22:26:50 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h40m0s]
    Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
  ```

  ```code
  $ tsh status
  > Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
    Logged in as:       myuser
    Cluster:            teleport.example.com
    Roles:              access, editor, reviewer
    Logins:             -teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe
    Kubernetes:         enabled
    Valid until:        2022-04-27 22:26:50 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h40m0s]
    Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
  ```

  ```code
  tsh status
  > Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
    Logged in as:       myuser
    Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
    Roles:              access, editor, reviewer
    Logins:             -teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe
    Kubernetes:         enabled
    Valid until:        2022-04-27 22:26:50 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h40m0s]
    Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
  ```

  In this example, `-teleport-nologin-d4bc1dad-ce49-4bbe-925d-a67f8d2d6afe` means
  that no logins have been assigned to the user.

  To add logins, retrieve your user configuration as YAML:

  ```code
  # Replace "myuser" with your Teleport username
  $ tctl get user/myuser > user.yaml
  ```

  Edit the `logins` field for your user. Each login must exist as a user on the
  host:

  ```diff
       db_users: null
       kubernetes_groups: null
       kubernetes_users: null
  -    logins: null
  +    logins:
  +      - root
       windows_logins: null
   version: v2
  ```

  Apply your changes:

  ```code
  $ tctl create -f user.yaml
  user "myuser" has been updated
  ```

  Log out of your cluster, then log in again. You should now see your Node when
  you run `tsh ls`.

<Accordion title="Hidden labels">
  If you wish to use labels for RBAC purposes but don't want to see the labels
  in the UI, you can put them in the hidden namespace by prefixing the label's
  key with `teleport.hidden/`, for example `teleport.hidden/account-id`.
</Accordion>

## Step 3/3. Apply dynamic labels via commands

Before following this step, stop Teleport on your Node.

As with static labels, you can apply dynamic labels by editing the
Teleport configuration file.

Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to define a `commands` array as shown below:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_server: tele.example.com:3025

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Configure dynamic labels using the "commands" field:
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
  - name: arch
    command: [uname, -p]
    # This setting tells Teleport to execute the command above
    # once an hour. This value cannot be less than one minute.
    period: 1h0m0s
```

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  proxy_server: mytenant.teleport.sh:443

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Configure dynamic labels using the "commands" field:
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
  - name: arch
    command: [uname, -p]
    # This setting tells Teleport to execute the command above
    # once an hour. This value cannot be less than one minute.
    period: 1h0m0s
```

Notice that the `command` setting is an array where the first element
is a valid executable and each subsequent element is an argument.

This is valid syntax:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/uname", "-m"]
```

This is invalid syntax:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/uname -m"]
```

If you want to pipe several bash commands together, here's how to do it. Notice
how `'` and `"` are interchangeable, so you can use them for nested quotations.

```yaml
command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "uname -a | egrep -o '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'"]
```

<Warning>
  When configuring a command to generate dynamic labels, the executable named
  within your command must be the path to a valid file. The executable permission
  bit must be set and shell scripts must have a
  [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_\(Unix\)).
</Warning>

Once you have configured your labels, start Teleport with the invite token you
created earlier:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --token=${INVITE_TOKEN?}
```

Verify that you have added the labels by running the following on your local
machine. Your Teleport user must be authorized to access the Node.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name         Address    Labels
----------------- ---------- ---------------
ip-192-0-2-0      ⟵ Tunnel arch=x86_64,hostname=ip-172-30-156-233
```

<Accordion title="Problems re-joining the Node?">
  Try creating another invite token using the `tctl tokens add` command from earlier
  and starting your Node again.

  If this doesn't work, delete the directory your Node uses to maintain its state,
  `/var/lib/teleport`, and try again.

## Next steps: Using labels

Once you have labeled your resources, you can refer to your labels when running
`tsh` and `tctl` commands to filter the resources that the commands will query.
For more information, see
[Resource filtering](/docs/ver/14.x/reference/predicate-language).

You can also use labels to limit the access that different roles have to
specific classes of resources. For more information, see
[Teleport Role Templates](/docs/ver/14.x/access-controls/guides/role-templates).
