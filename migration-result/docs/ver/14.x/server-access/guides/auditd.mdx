      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- A running Teleport Node. See the [Server Access Getting Started Guide](/docs/ver/14.x/server-access/getting-started) for  how to add a Node to your Teleport cluster. On the Node, `teleport` must be running as a systemd service with root permissions.
- Linux kernel 2.6.6+ compiled with `CONFIG_AUDIT`. Most Linux distributions have this option enabled by default.
- `auditctl` to check auditd status (optional).
- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  {/* Ignoring scope linting since we use this partial throughout the docs and
  cannot guarantee that it will line up with a page's configured scopes*/}
  {/*lint ignore scopes*/}
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  14.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  {/*lint ignore scopes*/}
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/4. Check system configuration

Teleport automatically sends auditd events when it discovers that auditd is enabled in the system.
You can verify that by calling `auditctl -s` as root.

Here is an example output from that command:

```bash
$ sudo auditctl -s
enabled 1
failure 1
pid 879
rate_limit 0
backlog_limit 8192
lost 0
backlog 0
backlog_wait_time 60000
backlog_wait_time_actual 0
loginuid_immutable 0 unlocked
```

The first line `enabled 1` indicates that auditd is enabled, and Teleport will send events.

All events are generated on a Teleport Node.
`invalid user` events are also generated on the Proxy Service when a Teleport user fails to authenticate.

## Step 2/4. Start Teleport

It's important to run Teleport as a system service (systemd service, for example) with root permissions.
Otherwise, Teleport won't send any events to auditd due to lack of permissions.

<Warning>
  Make sure that the Teleport process has its login UID unset. Otherwise, a session ID won't be set correctly in the emitted events.
  You can verify that by calling `cat /proc/$(pidof teleport)/loginuid`. The value should be set to 4294967295.
</Warning>

## Step 3/4. Enable the PAM integration (optional)

Auditd can generate additional events when PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is enabled. To enable the PAM integration
in Teleport, add the following `pam` section to the configuration file on your Teleport Node (`/etc/teleport.yaml` by default):

```yaml
ssh_service:
  # Enabled SSH Service
  enabled: true
  # Enable PAM integration
  pam:
    # "no" by default
    enabled: true
    # use /etc/pam.d/sshd configuration (the default)
    service_name: "sshd"
```

PAM-generated events depend on your `sshd` configuration when the integration is enabled. Most system generates events
like `USER_ACCT` or `USER_START`. Additionally, TTY input can be logged by enabling the `pam_tty_audit.so` module.

For more details please refer to [PAM](/docs/ver/14.x/server-access/guides/ssh-pam#set-up-pam-on-a-linux-machine-running-teleport) or your operating system
documentation.

When PAM integration is enabled, auditd events should closely match events generated by OpenSSH.

## Step 4/4. Trace SSH sessions with auditd

There are a few ways to trace SSH sessions in Teleport. To interact with auditd events, we will use `ausearch`.
If your system is missing that tool, consult your distribution documentation to check how to install it.

### Search by a system user

You can search events when logging in as a system user by using the `-ua` switch.
You can check the UID of a user by using the `id` command:

```
$ id bob
uid=1000(bob) gid=1000(bob) groups=1000(bob)
```

Then you can use `uid` to search auditd logs:

```
ausearch -ua 1000 -m USER_LOGIN
```

### Search by Teleport user

Events sent to auditd by Teleport are augmented by the `teleportUser` field, which contains the name of the Teleport user.
`ausearch` doesn't let you search by custom fields, but you can use `grep` for that:

```
ausearch -m USER_LOGIN | grep teleportUser=bob
```

### Search by session ID

If you want to find all events generated by a specific session, first, you need to find the session ID. You can do that
by using:

```
ausearch  -m USER_LOGIN -x teleport --just-one
```

Then search events only related to that one session:

```
ausearch --session 42
```
