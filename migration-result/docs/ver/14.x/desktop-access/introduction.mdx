The topics in this guide describe how to configure Teleport to provide secure, passwordless
access to Microsoft Windows desktops and servers. For Windows, Teleport provides the
following key features:

- Passwordless access to Windows hosts backed by secure cryptographic authentication.
- Configurable role-based access controls (RBAC) for groups of hosts and users.
- Configurable clipboard and directory sharing for copying and pasting to and from
  remote Windows hosts.
- Session recording for all desktop activity.
- Audit logs that track user activity.

Teleport Windows Desktop Services relies on the remote desktop protocol (RDP) to connect to
remote Windows hosts. Therefore, Teleport only supports the following Windows hosts that are
accessible over RDP:

- Windows Server 2012 R2, or later.
- Windows 10, or later.

The following diagram provides a simplified view of the architecture for managing
access to Windows computers through Teleport:

It's worth noting that the Teleport Windows Desktop Service implements a minimal set
of remote desktop protocol features to minimize security vulnerabilities for Windows
computers. Because secure access is the top priority, the Windows Desktop Service
might not be as performant as other RDP clients.

You should use the Teleport Windows Desktop Service to manage access
to Windows computers where you store or manipulate your most sensitive information,
rather than as a direct replacement for tools that provide general purpose access
to Windows computers.

## Getting started

You can configure Teleport Windows Desktop Service to control access for the following
scenarios:

- Local users who access computers that aren't joined to an Active Directory domain.
- Domain users who access computers that are joined to an Active Directory domain.

If you're managing access for combination of both local users and domain users, you'll
need to configure Teleport Windows Desktop Service for both scenarios. For more
information about configuring basic access using Teleport Windows Desktop Service, see
the following topics:

- [Configure access for local Windows users](/docs/ver/14.x/desktop-access/getting-started)
- [Configure access for Active Directory with scripts](/docs/ver/14.x/desktop-access/active-directory)
- [Configure access for Active Directory manually](/docs/ver/14.x/desktop-access/active-directory-manual)
