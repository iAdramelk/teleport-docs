This guide will walk you through the process of writing, testing, and adding the
first Login Rule to your Teleport cluster.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the Enterprise [Getting
      Started](/docs/ver/14.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 14.3.6.
      You can download these tools by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).
      You can verify the tools you have installed by running the following commands:

      ```bash
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v14.3.6 go1.21

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v14.3.6 go1.21
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 14.3.6.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/docs/ver/14.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```bash
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v14.3.6 go1.21

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v14.3.6 go1.21
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```bash
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  14.3.6
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.

Before you get started youâ€™ll need a running Teleport Enterprise or Cloud
cluster on version `11.3.1` or greater.

Login Rules only operate on SSO logins, so make sure you have
configured an OIDC, SAML, or GitHub connector before you begin.
Check the [Single Sign-On](/docs/ver/14.x/access-controls/sso) docs to learn how to set this up.

## Step 1/5. Configure RBAC

First, ensure you are logged into Teleport as a user that has permissions
to read and modify `login_rule` resources. The preset `editor` role
has access to this already, but in case you are using a more customized configuration,
create a role called `loginrule-manager.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: loginrule-manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: [login_rule]
        verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
version: v7
```

Create the role with `tctl`:

```bash
$ tctl create loginrule-manager.yaml
role 'loginrule-manager' has been created
```

Assign the `loginrule-manager` role to your Teleport user by running the appropriate
commands for your authentication provider:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local User">
    1. Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
       ```

    2. Edit `out.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the list of existing roles:

       ```diff
         roles:
          - access
          - auditor
          - editor
       +  - loginrule-manager 
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f out.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    1. Retrieve your `github` authentication connector:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `github.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       github.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `github.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the `teams_to_roles` section.

       The team you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the team must include your user account and
       should be the smallest team possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         teams_to_roles:
           - organization: octocats
             team: admins
             roles:
               - access
       +       - loginrule-manager
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f github.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML">
    1. Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `saml.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       saml.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the `attributes_to_roles` section.

       The attribute you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your
       user account and should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         attributes_to_roles:
           - name: "groups"
             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - loginrule-manager
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    1. Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `oidc.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       oidc.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the `claims_to_roles` section.

       The claim you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your organization's
       role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your user account and
       should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         claims_to_roles:
           - name: "groups"
             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - loginrule-manager
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/5. Draft your Login Rule resource

The following example will give all users a new `logins` trait set to the value
of their current `username` trait converted to lowercase.
Copy this example rule to a file called `my_rule.yaml` to continue with the
guide.

```
# my_rule.yaml
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  # Each Login Rule must have a unique name within the cluster.
  name: my_rule

  # expires is optional and usually should not be set for deployed login
  # rules, but it can be useful to set an expiry a short time in the future
  # while testing new Login Rules to prevent potentially locking yourself out of
  # your Teleport cluster.
  # expires: "2023-01-31T00:00:00-00:00"
spec:
  # priority orders the evaluation of Login Rules if multiple are present in the
  # cluster, lower priorities are evaluated first.
  priority: 0

  # traits_expression is a predicate expression which will be evaluated to
  # determine the final traits for each SSO user during login.
  #
  # This example expression sets the "logins" trait to the incoming "username"
  # trait converted to lowercase.
  traits_expression: 'external.put("logins", strings.lower(external["username"]))'
```

Each Login Rule resource must have either a `traits_map` or `traits_expression`
field.
In this guide we will use an example `traits_expression`.

The `traits_expression` is a form of script which will be evaluated by your
Teleport cluster at runtime to determine the traits for each SSO user who logs
in.
The expression can access the incoming traits for the user via the `external`
variable.
The `external` variable is a dictionary which maps trait keys to sets of values
for that trait.

## Step 3/5. Test the Login Rule

The `tctl login_rule test` command can be used to experiment with new Login
Rules to check their syntax and see exactly how they will operate on example
incoming traits.

Fetch your user's current traits and store them in `input.json`, then test your
new Login Rule with that input.

```bash
$ tctl get --format json users/username | jq 'first.spec.traits' > input.json
$ tctl login_rule test --resource-file my_rule.yaml input.json
access:
- staging
groups:
- dbs
- devs
logins:
- alice
```

This script will catch any syntax errors in your expressions.
Make sure that all expected traits are present in the output.

## Step 4/5. Create the Login Rule

Use the following command to create the Login Rule in your cluster:

```bash
$ tctl create my_rule.yaml
```

## Step 5/5. Try it out

As a final step, log out of your cluster, then log in again and make sure your user received the
expected traits and roles.
You can check the traits and roles with the following command:

```bash
$ tctl get --format json users/username | jq '{traits: first.spec.traits, roles: first.spec.roles}'
{
  "traits": {
	"access": [
	  "staging"
    ],
    "groups": [
      "dbs",
      "devs"
    ],
    "logins": [
      "alice"
    ]
  },
  "roles": [
    "access",
    "editor",
    "auditor"
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

The [`tctl sso test`](/docs/ver/14.x/reference/cli/tctl#tctl-sso-test) command can be used to
debug SSO logins and see exactly which traits are being sent by your SSO
provider and how they are being mapped by your Login Rules.

`tctl sso test` expects a connector spec.
Run the following command to debug with a connector currently installed in your
cluster.

```bash
$ tctl get connector/SSO connector name --with-secrets | tctl sso test
```

## Next steps

To learn more about the Login Rule expression syntax, check out the
[Login Rule Reference](/docs/ver/14.x/access-controls/login-rules/reference) page.

Learn about the `tctl login_rule test` command by running the help command or
checking the [reference page](/docs/ver/14.x/reference/cli/tctl#tctl-login_rule-test).

```bash
$ tctl help login_rule test
```

The following `tctl` resource commands are helpful for viewing and modifying the
login rules currently installed in your cluster.

| Command                           | Description                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `tctl get login_rules`            | Show all Login Rules installed in your cluster. |
| `tctl get login_rule/<rule_name>` | Get a specific installed Login Rule.            |
| `tctl create login_rule.yaml`     | Install a new Login Rule.                       |
| `tctl create -f login_rule.yaml`  | Overwrite an existing Login Rule.               |
| `tctl rm login_rule/<rule_name>`  | Delete a Login Rule.                            |

## Example Login Rules

### Set a trait to a static list of values defined per group

```yaml
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_expression: |
    external.put("allow-env",
      choose(
        option(external.group.contains("dev"), set("dev", "staging")),
        option(external.group.contains("qa"), set("qa", "staging")),
        option(external.group.contains("admin"), set("dev", "qa", "staging", "prod")),
        option(true, set()),
      ))
```

### Use only specific traits provided by the OIDC/SAML provider

To only keep the `groups` and `email` traits, with their original values:

```yaml
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_map:
    groups:
      - external.groups
    email:
      - external.email
```

### Remove a specific trait

To remove a specific trait and keep the rest:

```yaml
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_expression: |
    external.remove("big-trait")
```

### Extend a specific trait with extra values

```yaml
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_expression: |
    external.add_values("logins", "ubuntu", "ec2-user")
```

### Use the output of one Login Rule in another rule

```yaml
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  name: set_groups
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_expression: |
    external.put("groups",
      ifelse(external.groups.contains("admins"),
        external["groups"].add("superusers"),
        external["groups"]))
---
kind: login_rule
version: v1
metadata:
  name: set_logins
spec:
  priority: 1
  traits_expression: |
    ifelse(external.groups.contains("superusers"),
      external.add_values("logins", "root"),
      external)
```
