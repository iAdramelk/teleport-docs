title: Database Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)
description: Configure automatic user provisioning for databases.
version: '14.x'
---

<Accordion title="Version warning">
  Automatic user provisioning for PostgreSQL is available starting from
  Teleport 13.1.
</Accordion>

Teleport can automatically create users in your database, removing the need for
having to create each individual user account in advance, or using the same set
of shared database accounts for all users.

<Note>
  Currently, automatic user provisioning is only supported for self-hosted and
  RDS PostgreSQL databases.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster with a configured [self-hosted PostgreSQL](/docs/ver/14.x/database-access/guides/postgres-self-hosted)
  or [RDS PostgreSQL](/docs/ver/14.x/database-access/guides/rds) database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

Teleport should be able to connect to the database as a user that can create
other users and assign them roles. We recommend creating a separate user
designated specifically for Teleport automatic user provisioning. Let's call it
`teleport-admin`.

Teleport will use the same authentication mechanism when connecting as an admin
user as for regular user connections: X.509 for self-hosted databases and AWS
IAM for RDS. The admin user must have privileges within the database to create
users and grant them privileges.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RDS PostgreSQL">
    The RDS PostgreSQL admin user must have the `rds_iam` role attached to allow IAM
    authentication:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER "teleport-admin" login createrole;
    GRANT rds_iam TO "teleport-admin";
    ```

    Note that the RDS database must have IAM authentication enabled.

    Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html) to make sure you are using the `rds_iam` role correctly.
    for more information.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-hosted PostgreSQL">
    The self-hosted PostgreSQL admin user must have X.509 authentication configured.

    ```sql
    CREATE USER "teleport-admin" login createrole;
    ```

    Note that the database must be configured to accept client certificate auth
    for the admin user by having the following entries in `pg_hba.conf`:

    ```conf
    hostssl all             all             ::/0                    cert
    hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0               cert
    ```

    Refer to the [self-hosted PostgreSQL guide](/docs/ver/14.x/database-access/guides/postgres-self-hosted#step-35-configure-your-postgresql-server)
    to ensure that your configuration is correct.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Users created by Teleport will be placed in the `teleport-auto-users` group in
the database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Teleport will not delete the automatically created user at the end of the session.
Instead, the user will be stripped of all roles, updated with `nologin` trait
and reactivated during the next connection.

Next, enable the database admin on the Teleport database configuration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static config">
    ```yaml
    db_service:
      enabled: "yes"
      databases:
      - name: "example"
        protocol: "postgres"
        uri: "localhost:5432"
        admin_user:
          name: "teleport-admin"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dynamic resource">
    ```yaml
    kind: db
    version: v3
    metadata:
      name: example
    spec:
      protocol: "postgres"
      uri: "localhost:5432"
      admin_user:
        name: "teleport-admin"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  For auto-discovered cloud databases, the name of the admin user is taken from
  the `teleport.dev/db-admin` label.
</Tip>

## Step 2/3. Configure Teleport role

To specify the database roles a user should be assigned within the database,
use the `db_roles` role option:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: auto-db-users
spec:
  options:
    # create_db_user enables automatic user provisioning for matching databases
    create_db_user: true
  allow:
    db_labels:
      "*": "*"
    db_names:
    - "*"
    # db_roles is a list of roles the database user will be assigned
    db_roles:
    - reader
    - "{{internal.db_roles}}"
    - "{{external.db_roles}}"
```

With automatic user provisioning, users always connect to the database with
their Teleport username so the `db_users` role field is ignored for roles
that have database user provisioning enabled.

User created within the database will:

- Have the same name as Teleport username.
- Be a part of the `teleport-auto-users` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database. See PostgreSQL
  [CREATE ROLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html)
  for information on how to create database roles.

Note that in case of a name conflict where a user with the same name already
exists in the database and is not managed by Teleport (i.e. not a part of the
`teleport-auto-users` group), the connection will be aborted.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

Now, log into your Teleport cluster and connect to the database:

```
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com
$ tsh db connect example
```

If using a GUI database client like pgAdmin, make sure to use your Teleport
username as a database username. `tsh db connect` will default to it automatically
when connecting to a database with user provisioning enabled.
