description: How to use Machine ID with tctl to manage your Teleport configuration
version: "16.x"
---

`tctl` is the Teleport cluster management CLI tool. Whilst it usually uses the
credentials from the locally logged in user, it is also possible to use
Machine ID credentials. This allows `tctl` to be leveraged as part of a custom
automation workflow deployed in a non-interactive environment (e.g CI/CD).

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials for `tctl`, and
then use `tctl` to deploy Teleport roles defined in files.

    Proxy version: 14.3.6
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```bash
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  16.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  use `tctl`. For more information, see the
  [deployment guides](/docs/ver/16.x/machine-id/deployment).

## Step 1/3. Configure RBAC

First, Teleport must be configured to allow the credentials produced by `tbot`
to modify the Teleport configuration. It's important to grant as few
privileges as possible in order to limit the blast radius of an attack, so in
this example we grant only the ability to create and update roles.

If you have followed a platform guide, you will have created a role and granted
the bot the ability to impersonate it already. This role just needs to have the
additional privileges added to it.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following rule to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      # Specify the names of resources you wish to manage with tctl.
      # For this guide, we will only manage roles.
      - role
      verbs:
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
      - list
```

## Step 2/3. Configure `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output that will produce the
credentials needed by `tctl`. As `tctl` will be accessing the Teleport API, the
correct output type to use is `identity`.

For this guide, the `directory` destination will be used. This will write these
credentials to a specified directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can
be written to by the Linux user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by
the Linux user that `tctl` will run as.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to execute the Terraform
plan later.

You should now see an `identity` file under `/opt/machine-id`. This contains
the private key and signed certificates needed by `tctl` to
authenticate with the Teleport Auth Server.

## Step 3/3. Use `tctl` with the identity output

As an example, `tctl` will be used to apply a directory of YAML files that
define Teleport roles. If these were stored in version control (e.g., `git`) and
this were executed on change, this would form the basis for managing Teleport
roles in a GitOps style.

The example role will not be useful within the context of your Teleport cluster
and should be modified once you have completed this guide.

Create a directory called `roles/` and within it create `example.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: tctl-test
spec:
  # This role does nothing as it is an example role.
  allow: {}
```

To configure `tctl` to use the identity file, the `-i` flag is used. As the
identity file does not specify the address of Teleport, `--auth-server` must
also be specified with the address of your Teleport Proxy or Teleport Auth
Server.

Run `tctl`, replacing `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your
Teleport Proxy or Auth Server and `/opt/machine-id/identity` with the path to
the generated identity file if you have modified this:

```bash
$ tctl --auth-server example.teleport.sh:443 -i /opt/machine-id/identity create -f roles/*.yaml
```

Check your Teleport cluster, ensuring the role has been created.

```bash
$ tctl get role/tctl-test
```

## Next steps

- Explore the [`tctl` reference](/docs/ver/16.x/reference/cli/tctl) to discover all
  `tctl` can do.
- Read the [configuration reference](/docs/ver/16.x/machine-id/reference/configuration) to explore
  all the available `tbot` configuration options.
