title: Run the Slack Access Request Plugin
description: How to set up Teleport's Slack plugin for privilege elevation approvals.
version: '16.x'
---

This guide will explain how to set up Slack to receive Access Request messages
from Teleport. Teleport's Slack integration notifies individuals and channels of
Access Requests. Users are then directed to log in to the Teleport cluster where
they can approve and deny Access Requests, making it easier to implement security
best practices without compromising productivity.

<Accordion title="This integration is hosted on Teleport Cloud">
  In Teleport Team and Teleport Enterprise Cloud, Teleport manages the Slack integration for
  you, and you can enroll the Slack integration from the Teleport Web UI.

  Visit the Teleport Web UI and click **Access Management** on the menu bar at the
  top of the screen.

  On the left sidebar, click **Enroll New Integration** to visit the "Enroll New
  Integration" page:

  ![Enroll an Access Request plugin](/assets/enroll-336e8c2e41.png)

  On the "Select Integration Type" menu, click the tile for your integration. You
  will see a page with instructions to set up the integration, as well as a form
  that you can use to configure the integration.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Enterprise edition of Teleport running in your environment.

  For information about the differences between Teleport editions, see [Comparing
  editions](/docs/ver/16.x/choose-an-edition/introduction#comparing-editions).

- The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 16.0.0-dev.

  You can verify the tools you have installed by running the following commands:

  ```code
  $ tctl version
  # Teleport Enterprise v16.0.0-dev go1.22

  $ tsh version
  # Teleport v16.0.0-dev go1.22
  ```

  You can download these tools by following the appropriate [Installation
  instructions](/docs/ver/16.x/installation#installation-instructions) for your environment and Teleport edition.

**Recommended:** Configure Machine ID to provide short-lived Teleport
credentials to the plugin. Before following this guide, follow a Machine ID
[deployment guide](/docs/ver/16.x/machine-id/deployment) to run the `tbot` binary on
your infrastructure.

- Slack admin privileges to create an app and install it to your workspace. Your
  Slack profile must have the "Workspace Owner" or "Workspace Admin" banner
  below your profile picture.
- Either a Linux host or Kubernetes cluster where you will run the Slack plugin.

To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
`tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

For example:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
$ tctl status
# Cluster  teleport.example.com
# Version  16.0.0-dev
# CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
```

If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.

## Step 1/8. Define RBAC resources

Before you set up the Slack plugin, you will need to enable Role Access Requests
in your Teleport cluster.

For the purpose of this guide, we will define an `editor-requester` role, which
can request the built-in `editor` role, and an `editor-reviewer` role that can
review requests for the `editor` role.

Create a file called `editor-request-rbac.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: editor-reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles: ['editor']
---
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: editor-requester
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles: ['editor']
      thresholds:
        - approve: 1
          deny: 1
```

Create the roles you defined:

```code
$ tctl create -f editor-request-rbac.yaml
role 'editor-reviewer' has been created
role 'editor-requester' has been created
```

Allow yourself to review requests by users with the `editor-requester` role by
assigning yourself the `editor-reviewer` role.

Assign the `editor-reviewer` role to your Teleport user by running the appropriate
commands for your authentication provider:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local User">
    1. Retrieve your local user's roles as a comma-separated list:

       ```code
       $ ROLES=$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.roles | join(",")')
       ```

    2. Edit your local user to add the new role:

       ```code
       $ tctl users update $(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') \
         --set-roles "${ROLES?},editor-reviewer"
       ```

    3. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    1. Retrieve your `github` authentication connector:

       ```code
       $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `github.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       github.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `github.yaml`, adding `editor-reviewer` to the `teams_to_roles` section.

       The team you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the team must include your user account and
       should be the smallest team possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         teams_to_roles:
           - organization: octocats
             team: admins
             roles:
               - access
       +       - editor-reviewer
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```code
       $ tctl create -f github.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML">
    1. Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

       ```code
       $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `saml.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       saml.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `editor-reviewer` to the `attributes_to_roles` section.

       The attribute you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your
       user account and should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         attributes_to_roles:
           - name: "groups"
             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - editor-reviewer
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```code
       $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    1. Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

       ```code
       $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `oidc.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       oidc.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `editor-reviewer` to the `claims_to_roles` section.

       The claim you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your organization's
       role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your user account and
       should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         claims_to_roles:
           - name: "groups"
             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - editor-reviewer
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```code
       $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Create a user called `myuser` who has the `editor-requester` role. This user
cannot edit your cluster configuration unless they request the `editor` role:

```code
$ tctl users add myuser --roles=editor-requester 
```

`tctl` will print an invitation URL to your terminal. Visit the URL and log in
as `myuser` for the first time, registering credentials as configured for your
Teleport cluster.

Later in this guide, you will have `myuser` request the `editor` role so you can
review the request using the Teleport plugin.

## Step 2/8. Install the Teleport Slack plugin

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Download">
    We currently only provide `linux-amd64` binaries. You can also compile these
    plugins from source. You can run the plugin from a remote host or your local
    development machine.

    ```code
    $ curl -L -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-slack-v13.3.7-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf teleport-access-slack-v13.3.7-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    $ cd teleport-access-slack
    $ sudo ./install
    ```

    Make sure the binary is installed:

    ```code
    $ teleport-slack version
    teleport-slack v13.3.7 git:teleport-slack-v13.3.7-fffffffff go1.22
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Docker Image">
    We currently only provide Docker images for `linux-amd64`.
    Pull the Docker image for the latest access request plugin by running the following command:

    ```code
    $ docker pull public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-slack:13.3.7
    ```

    Make sure the plugin is installed by running the following command:

    ```

    For a list of available tags, visit [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-slack).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From Source">
    To install from source you need `git` and `go` installed. If you do not have Go
    installed, visit the Go [downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

    ```code
    $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
    $ cd teleport-plugins/access/slack
    $ make
    ```

    Move the `teleport-slack` binary into your PATH.

    Make sure the binary is installed:

    ```code
    $ teleport-slack version
    teleport-slack v13.3.7 git:teleport-slack-v13.3.7-fffffffff go1.22
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    {/*TODO: Replace this with the following partial once we fix
    gravitational/docs#299:
    docs/pages/kubernetes-access/helm/includes/helm-repo-add.mdx*/}

    Allow Helm to install charts that are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository:

    ```code
    $ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
    ```

    Update the cache of charts from the remote repository:

    ```code
    $ helm repo update
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/8. Create a user and role for the plugin

Teleport's Access Request plugins authenticate to your Teleport cluster as a
user with permissions to list and read Access Requests. This way, plugins can
retrieve Access Requests from the Teleport Auth Service and present them to
reviewers.

Define a user and role called `access-plugin` by adding the following content to
a file called `access-plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']

      # In order to provide access list review reminders, permissions to list and read access lists
      # are necessary. This is currently only supported for a subset of plugins.
      - resources: ['access_list']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']

    # Optional: To display user-friendly names in resource-based Access
    # Requests instead of resource IDs, the plugin also needs permission
    # to list the resources being requested. Include this along with the
    # list-access-request-resources role definition.
    review_requests:
      preview_as_roles:
        - list-access-request-resources
---
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
---
# Optional, for displaying friendly names of resources. Resource types and
# labels can be further limited to only the resources that access can be
# requested to.
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: list-access-request-resources
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['node', 'app', 'db', 'kube_cluster']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    group_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Create the user and role:

```code
$ tctl create -f access-plugin.yaml
```

As with all Teleport users, the Teleport Auth Service authenticates the
`access-plugin` user by issuing short-lived TLS credentials. In this case, we
will need to request the credentials manually by *impersonating* the
`access-plugin` role and user.

If you are running a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployment and are using
`tctl` from the Auth Service host, you will already have impersonation
privileges.

To grant your user impersonation privileges for `access-plugin`, define a role
called `access-plugin-impersonator` by pasting the following YAML document into
a file called `access-plugin-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: access-plugin-impersonator
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
```

Create the `access-plugin-impersonator` role:

```code
$ tctl create -f access-plugin-impersonator.yaml
```

If you are providing identity files to the plugin with Machine ID, assign the
`access-plugin` role to the Machine ID bot user. Otherwise, assign this role to
the user you plan to use to generate credentials for the `access-plugin` role
and user:

Assign the `access-plugin-impersonator` role to your Teleport user by running the appropriate
commands for your authentication provider:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local User">
    1. Retrieve your local user's roles as a comma-separated list:

       ```code
       $ ROLES=$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.roles | join(",")')
       ```

    2. Edit your local user to add the new role:

       ```code
       $ tctl users update $(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') \
         --set-roles "${ROLES?},access-plugin-impersonator"
       ```

    3. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    1. Retrieve your `github` authentication connector:

       ```code
       $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `github.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       github.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `github.yaml`, adding `access-plugin-impersonator` to the `teams_to_roles` section.

       The team you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the team must include your user account and
       should be the smallest team possible within your organization.

               - access
       +       - access-plugin-impersonator
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```code
       $ tctl create -f github.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML">
    1. Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

       ```code
       $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `saml.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       saml.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `access-plugin-impersonator` to the `attributes_to_roles` section.

       The attribute you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your

             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - access-plugin-impersonator
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```code
       $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    1. Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

       ```code
       $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `oidc.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       oidc.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `access-plugin-impersonator` to the `claims_to_roles` section.

       The claim you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your organization's
       role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your user account and

             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - access-plugin-impersonator
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```code
       $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You will now be able to generate signed certificates for the `access-plugin`
role and user.

## Step 4/8. Export the access plugin identity

Give the plugin access to a Teleport identity file. We recommend using Machine
ID for this in order to produce short-lived identity files that are less
dangerous if exfiltrated, though in demo deployments, you can generate
longer-lived identity files with `tctl`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Machine ID">
    Configure `tbot` with an output that will produce the credentials needed by
    the plugin. As the plugin will be accessing the Teleport API, the correct
    output type to use is `identity`.

    For this guide, the `directory` destination will be used. This will write these
    credentials to a specified directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can
    be written to by the Linux user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by
    the Linux user that the plugin will run as.

    Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output.

    If running `tbot` on a Linux server, use the `directory` output to write
    identity files to the `/opt/machine-id` directory:

    ```yaml
    outputs:
    - type: identity
      destination:
        type: directory
        # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
        # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
        # destination.
        path: /opt/machine-id
    ```

    If running `tbot` on Kubernetes, write the identity file to Kubernetes secret
    instead:

    ```yaml
    outputs:
      - type: identity
        destination:
          type: kubernetes_secret
          name: teleport-plugin-slack-identity
    ```

    If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
    one-shot mode, execute it now.

    You should now see an `identity` file under `/opt/machine-id` or a Kubernetes
    secret named `teleport-plugin-slack-identity`. This contains the private key and signed
    certificates needed by the plugin to authenticate with the Teleport Auth
    Service.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Long-lived identity files">
    Like all Teleport users, `access-plugin` needs signed credentials in order to
    connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign` command to
    request these credentials.

    The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `access-plugin` user,
    generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
    directory:

    ```code
    $ tctl auth sign --user=access-plugin --out=identity
    ```

    The plugin connects to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

    The identity file, `identity`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. The
    plugin uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service, which
    establishes a reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The plugin
    uses this reverse tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the
    Auth Service's gRPC endpoint.

    <Accordion title="Certificate Lifetime">
      By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
      lifetime. For production deployments, we suggest using [Machine
      ID](/docs/ver/16.x/machine-id/introduction) to programmatically issue and renew
      certificates for your plugin. See our Machine ID [getting started
      guide](/docs/ver/16.x/machine-id/getting-started) to learn more.

      Note that you cannot issue certificates that are valid longer than your existing credentials.
      For example, to issue certificates with a 1000-hour TTL, you must be logged in with a session that is
      valid for at least 1000 hours. This means your user must have a role allowing
      a `max_session_ttl` of at least 1000 hours (60000 minutes), and you must specify a `--ttl`
      when logging in:

      ```code
      $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --ttl=60060
      ```
    </Accordion>

    If you are running the plugin on a Linux server, create a data directory
    to hold certificate files for the plugin:

    ```code
    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport/api-credentials
    $ sudo mv identity /var/lib/teleport/plugins/api-credentials
    ```

    If you are running the plugin on Kubernetes, Create a Kubernetes secret
    that contains the Teleport identity file:

    ```code
    $ kubectl -n teleport create secret generic --from-file=identity teleport-plugin-slack-identity
    ```

    Once the Teleport credentials expire, you will need to renew them by running the
    `tctl auth sign` command again.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5/8. Register a Slack app

The Access Request plugin for Slack receives Access Request events from the
Teleport Auth Service, formats them into Slack messages, and sends them to the
Slack API to post them in your workspace. For this to work, you must register a
new app with the Slack API.

### Create your app

Visit [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) to create a new
Slack app. Click "Create an App", then "From scratch". Fill in the form as shown
below:

![Create Slack App](/assets/Create-a-Slack-App-ee24822a33.png)

The "App Name" should be "Teleport". Click the "Development Slack Workspace"
dropdown and choose the workspace where you would like to see Access Request
messages.

### Generate an OAuth token with scopes

Next, configure your application to authenticate to the Slack API. We will do
this by generating an OAuth token that the plugin will present to the Slack API.

We will restrict the plugin to the narrowest possible permissions by using OAuth
scopes. The Slack plugin needs to post messages to your workspace. It also needs
to read usernames and email addresses in order to direct Access Request
notifications from the Auth Service to the appropriate Teleport users in Slack.

After creating your app, the Slack website will open a console where you can
specify configuration options. On the sidebar menu under "Features", click
"OAuth & Permissions".

Scroll to the "Scopes" section and click "Add an OAuth Scope" for each of the
following scopes:

- `chat:write`
- `incoming-webhook`
- `users:read`
- `users:read.email`

The result should look like this:

![API Scopes](/assets/api-scopes-49ae0afd3c.png)

After you have configured scopes for your plugin, scroll back to the top of the
OAuth & Permissions page, find the "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace" section,
and click "Install to Workspace". You will see a summary of the permission you
configured for the Slack plugin earlier.

In "Where should Teleport post?", choose "Slackbot" as the default channel the
plugin will post to. The plugin will post here when sending direct messages.
Later in this guide, we will configure the plugin to post in other channels as
well.

After submitting this form, you will see an OAuth token in the "OAuth &
Permissions" tab under "Tokens for Your Workspace":

![OAuth Tokens](/assets/OAuth-ab2b4b7547.png)

You will use this token later when configuring the Slack plugin.

## Step 6/8. Configure the Teleport Slack plugin

At this point, the Teleport Slack plugin has the credentials it needs to
communicate with your Teleport cluster and the Slack API. In this step, you will
configure the Slack plugin to use these credentials. You will also configure the
plugin to notify the right Slack channels when it receives an Access Request
update.

### Create a configuration file

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable or Docker">
    The Teleport Slack plugin uses a configuration file in TOML format. Generate a
    boilerplate configuration by running the following command (the plugin will not run
    unless the config file is in `/etc/teleport-slack.toml`):

    ```code
    $ teleport-slack configure | sudo tee /etc/teleport-slack.toml > /dev/null
    ```

    This should result in a configuration file like the one below:

    ```toml
    # Example Slack plugin configuration TOML file

    [teleport]

    # Teleport Auth/Proxy Server address.
    # addr = "example.com:3025"
    #
    # Should be port 3025 for Auth Server and 3080 or 443 for Proxy.
    # For Teleport Cloud, should be in the form "your-account.teleport.sh:443".

    # Credentials generated with `tctl auth sign`.
    #
    # When using --format=file:
    # identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/identity"   # Identity file
    # refresh_identity = true                                 # Refresh identity file on a periodic basis
    #
    # When using --format=tls:
    # client_key = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/auth.key" # Teleport TLS secret key
    # client_crt = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/auth.crt" # Teleport TLS certificate
    # root_cas = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/auth.cas"   # Teleport CA certs

    [slack]
    # Slack Bot OAuth token
    # You can also use an absolute path to a token file, e.g., 
    # "/var/lib/teleport/token"
    token = "xoxb-11xx"

    [role_to_recipients]
    # Map roles to recipients.
    #
    # Provide slack user_email/channel recipients for access requests for specific roles. 
    # role.suggested_reviewers will automatically be treated as additional email recipients.
    # "*" must be provided to match non-specified roles.
    #
    # "dev" = "devs-slack-channel"
    # "*" = ["admin@email.com", "admin-slack-channel"]

    [log]
    output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/slack.log"
    severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".

    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    The Slack Helm Chart uses a YAML values file to configure the plugin.
    On your local workstation, create a file called `teleport-slack-helm.yaml`
    based on the following example:

    ```toml
    teleport:
      # Teleport HTTPS Proxy Web Address, for Teleport Enterprise Cloud should be in the form "your-account.teleport.sh:443"
      address: "teleport.example.com:443"
      # Secret containing identity
      identitySecretName: teleport-plugin-slack-identity
      # Path within the secret containing the identity file.
      identitySecretPath: identity

    slack:
      token: "xoxb-11xx"  # Slack Bot OAuth token

    # Mapping from role to recipients
    roleToRecipients: []
      # "dev": "devs-slack-channel"
      # "*": ["admin@email.com", "admin-slack-channel"]

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Edit the configuration file

Open the configuration file created for the Teleport Slack plugin and update the following fields:

**`[teleport]`**

The Slack plugin uses this section to connect to your Teleport cluster:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable or Docker">
    **`addr`**: Include the hostname and HTTPS port of your Teleport Proxy Service
    or Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant (e.g., `teleport.example.com:443` or
    `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`).

    **`identity`**: Fill this in with the path to the identity file you exported
    earlier.

    **`client_key`**, **`client_crt`**, **`root_cas`**: Comment these out, since we
    are not using them in this configuration.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    **`address`**: Include the hostname and HTTPS port of your Teleport Proxy Service
    or Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant (e.g., `teleport.example.com:443` or
    `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`).

    **`identitySecretName`**: Fill in the `identitySecretName` field with the name
    of the Kubernetes secret you created earlier.

    **`identitySecretPath`**: Fill in the `identitySecretPath` field with the path
    of the identity file within the Kubernetes secret. If you have followed the
    instructions above, this will be `identity`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you are providing credentials to the plugin using a `tbot` binary that runs
on a Linux server, make sure the value of `identity` is the same as the path of
the identity file you configured `tbot` to generate, `/opt/machine-id/identity`.

Configure the plugin to periodically reload the identity file, ensuring that it
does not attempt to connect to the Teleport Auth Service with expired
credentials.

Add the following to the `teleport` section of the configuration:

```toml
refresh_identity = true
```

**`[slack]`**

`token`: Open [`https://api.slack.com/apps`](https://api.slack.com/apps), find
the Slack app you created earlier, navigate to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab,
copy the "Bot User OAuth Token", and paste it into this field.

**`[role_to_recipients]`**

The `role_to_recipients` map configure the channels that the Slack plugin will
notify when a user requests access to a specific role. When the Slack plugin
receives an Access Request from the Auth Service, it will look up the role being
requested and identify the Slack channels to notify.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable or Docker">
    Here is an example of a `role_to_recipients` map:

    ```toml
    [role_to_recipients]
    "*" = "admin-slack-channel"
    "dev" = ["dev-slack-channel", "admin-slack-channel"]
    "dba" = "alex@gmail.com"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    In our Helm chart, the `role_to_recipients` field is called `roleToRecipients`
    and uses the following format:

    ```yaml
    roleToRecipients:
      "*": "admin-slack-channel"
      "dev":
        - "dev-slack-channel"
        - "admin-slack-channel"
      "dba": "alex@gmail.com"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In the `role_to_recipients` map, each key is the name of a Teleport role. Each
value configures the Slack channel (or channels) to notify. The value can be a
single string or an array of strings. Each string must be either the name of a
Slack channel (including a user's direct message channel) or the email address
of a Slack user. If the recipient is an email address, the Slack plugin will
use that email address to look up a direct message channel.

The `role_to_recipients` map must also include an entry for `"*"`, which the
plugin looks up if no other entry matches a given role name. In the example
above, requests for roles aside from `dev` and `dba` will notify the
`admin-slack-channel` channel.

<Accordion title="Suggested reviewers">
  Users can suggest reviewers when they create an Access Request, e.g.,:

  ```code
  $ tsh request create --roles=dbadmin --reviewers=alice@example.com,ivan@example.com
  ```

  If an Access Request includes suggested reviewers, the Slack plugin will add
  these to the list of channels to notify. If a suggested reviewer is an email
  address, the plugin will look up the the direct message channel for that
  address and post a message in that channel.
</Accordion>

Configure the Slack plugin to notify you when a user requests the `editor` role
by adding the following to your `role_to_recipients` config (replace
`TELEPORT_USERNAME` with the user you assigned the `editor-reviewer` role
earlier):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable or Docker">
    ```toml
    [role_to_recipients]
    "*" = "access-requests"
    "editor" = "TELEPORT_USERNAME"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    ```yaml
    roleToRecipients:
      "*": "access-requests"
      "editor": "TELEPORT_USERNAME"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Either create an `access-requests` channel in your Slack workspace or rename the
value of the `"*"` key to an existing channel.

### Invite your Slack app

Once you have configured the channels that the Slack plugin will notify when it
receives an Access Request, you will need to ensure that the plugin can post in
those channels.

You have already configured the plugin to send direct messages as Slackbot. For
any other channel you mention in your `role_to_recipients` map, you will need
to invite the plugin to that channel. Navigate to each channel and enter `/invite
@teleport` in the message box.

## Step 7/8. Test your Slack app

Once Teleport is running, you've created the Slack app, and the plugin is
configured, you can now run the plugin and test the workflow.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable">
    Start the plugin:

    ```code
    $ teleport-slack start
    ```

    If everything works fine, the log output should look like this:

    ```code
    $ teleport-slack start
    INFO   Starting Teleport Access Slack Plugin 7.2.1: slack/app.go:80
    INFO   Plugin is ready slack/app.go:101
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Docker">
    run the plugin:

    ```code
    $ docker run -v <path-to-config>:/etc/teleport-slack.toml public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-slack:16.0.0-dev start
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    Install the plugin:

    ```code
    $ helm upgrade --install teleport-plugin-slack teleport/teleport-plugin-slack --values teleport-slack-helm.yaml
    ```

    To inspect the plugin's logs, use the following command:

    ```code
    $ kubectl logs deploy/teleport-plugin-slack
    ```

    Debug logs can be enabled by setting `log.severity` to `DEBUG` in
    `teleport-slack-helm.yaml` and executing the `helm upgrade ...` command
    above again. Then you can restart the plugin with the following command:

    ```code
    $ kubectl rollout restart deployment teleport-plugin-slack
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Create an Access Request and check if the plugin works as expected with the
following steps.

### Create an Access Request

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="As an Admin">
    A Teleport admin can create an Access Request for another user with `tctl`:

    ```code
    $ tctl request create myuser --roles=editor
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="As a User">
    Users can use `tsh` to create an Access Request and log in with approved roles:

    ```code
    $ tsh request create --roles=editor
    Seeking request approval... (id: 8f77d2d1-2bbf-4031-a300-58926237a807)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From the Web UI">
    Users can request access using the Web UI by visiting the "Access Requests"
    tab and clicking "New Request":

    ![Creating an Access Request using the Web UI](/assets/request-access-989f648dce.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The user you configured earlier to review the request should receive a direct
message from "Teleport" in Slack allowing them to visit a link in the Teleport
Web UI and either approve or deny the request.

### Resolve the request

Once you receive an Access Request message, click the link to visit Teleport and
approve or deny the request:

![Reviewing a request](/assets/review-request-a35de046df.png)

<Accordion title="Reviewing from the command line">
  You can also review an Access Request from the command line:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="As an Admin">
      ```code
      # Replace REQUEST_ID with the id of the request
      $ tctl request approve REQUEST_ID
      $ tctl request deny REQUEST_ID
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="As a User">
      ```code
      # Replace REQUEST_ID with the id of the request
      $ tsh request review --approve REQUEST_ID
      $ tsh request review --deny REQUEST_ID
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Accordion>

Once the request is resolved, the Slack bot will add an emoji reaction of ✅ or
❌ to the Slack message for the Access Request, depending on whether the request
was approved or denied.

<Note>
  When the Slack plugin posts an Access Request notification to a channel, anyone
  with access to the channel can view the notification and follow the link. While
  users must be authorized via their Teleport roles to review Access Requests, you
  should still check the Teleport audit log to ensure that the right users are
  reviewing the right requests.

  When auditing Access Request reviews, check for events with the type `Access
  Request Reviewed` in the Teleport Web UI.
</Note>

## Step 8/8. Set up systemd

This section is only relevant if you are running the Teleport Slack plugin on a
Linux host.

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init
system like systemd.  Here's the recommended Teleport plugin service unit file
for systemd:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Teleport Slack Plugin
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/teleport-slack start --config=/etc/teleport-slack.toml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/teleport-slack.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save this as `teleport-slack.service` in either `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or
another [unit file load
path](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path)
supported by systemd.

Enable and start the plugin:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport-slack
$ sudo systemctl start teleport-slack
```
