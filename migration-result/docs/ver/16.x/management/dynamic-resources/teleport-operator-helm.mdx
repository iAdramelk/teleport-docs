title: Kubernetes Operator in teleport-cluster Helm chart
description: Deploy the operator alongside your Helm-deployed Teleport Cluster.
version: '16.x'
---

This guide explains how to run the Teleport Kubernetes Operator alongside a Teleport cluster
deployed via the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart.

<Warning>
  If your Teleport cluster is not deployed using the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart
  (Teleport Cloud, manually deployed, deployed via Terraform, ...), you need to follow
  [the standalone operator guide](/docs/ver/16.x/management/dynamic-resources/teleport-operator-standalone) instead.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (with or without `teleport-cluster` Helm chart already deployed);
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Validate Kubernetes connectivity by running the following command:

```code
$ kubectl cluster-info
# Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443
# CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
# Metrics-server is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:https/proxy
```

<Tip>
  Users wanting to experiment locally with the operator can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
  to start a local Kubernetes cluster:

  ```code
  $ minikube start
  ```
</Tip>

## Step 1/2. Install teleport-cluster Helm chart with the operator

Set up the Teleport Helm repository.

Allow Helm to install charts that are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository:

```code
$ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
```

Update the cache of charts from the remote repository so you can upgrade to all
available releases:

```code
$ helm repo update
```

Install the Helm chart for the Teleport Cluster with `operator.enabled=true`
in the TELEPORT-CLUSTER namespace:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Teleport Community Edition">
    ```code
    $ helm install teleport-cluster teleport/teleport-cluster \
            --create-namespace --namespace teleport-cluster \
            --set clusterName=teleport-cluster.teleport-cluster.svc.cluster.local \
            --set operator.enabled=true \
            --version 16.0.0-dev
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise">
    Create a namespace for your Teleport cluster resources:

    ```code
    $ kubectl create namespace teleport-cluster
    ```

    The Teleport Auth Service reads a license file to authenticate your Teleport
    Enterprise account.

    To obtain your license file, navigate to your Teleport account dashboard and log
    in. You can start at [teleport.sh](https://teleport.sh) and enter your Teleport
    account name (e.g. my-company). After logging in you will see a "GENERATE
    LICENSE KEY" button, which will generate a new license file and allow you to
    download it.

    Create a secret called "license" in the namespace you created:

    ```code
    $ kubectl -n teleport-cluster create secret generic license --from-file=license.pem
    ```

    Deploy your Teleport cluster and the Teleport Kubernetes Operator:

    ```code
    $ helm install teleport-cluster teleport/teleport-cluster \
            --namespace teleport-cluster \
            --set enterprise=true \
            --set clusterName=teleport-cluster.teleport-cluster.svc.cluster.local \
            --set operator.enabled=true \
            --version 16.0.0-dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This command installs the required Kubernetes CRDs and deploys the Teleport Kubernetes Operator next to the Teleport
cluster. All resources (except CRDs, which are cluster-scoped) are created in the `teleport-cluster` namespace.

## Step 2/2. Validate the cluster and operator are running and healthy

```code
$ kubectl get deployments -n teleport-cluster
#

$ kubectl get pods -n teleport-cluster
#
```

## Next steps

Follow [the user and role IaC guide](/docs/ver/16.x/management/dynamic-resources/user-and-role) to use your newly
deployed Teleport Kubernetes Operator to create Teleport users and grant them
roles.

Helm Chart parameters are documented in the [`teleport-cluster` Helm chart reference](/docs/ver/16.x/reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster).

See the [Helm Deployment guides](/docs/ver/16.x/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments) detailing specific setups like running Teleport on AWS or GCP.

## Troubleshooting

### The CustomResources (CRs) are not reconciled

The Teleport Operator watches for new resources or changes in Kubernetes.
When a change happens, it triggers the reconciliation loop. This loop is in
charge of validating the resource, checking if it already exists in Teleport
and making calls to the Teleport API to create/update/delete the resource.
The reconciliation loop also adds a `status` field on the Kubernetes resource.

If an error happens and the reconciliation loop is not successful, an item in
`status.conditions` will describe what went wrong. This allows users to diagnose
errors by inspecting Kubernetes resources with `kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl describe teleportusers myuser
```

For example, if a user has been granted a nonexistent role the status will look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v2
kind: TeleportUser
# [...]
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-25T16:15:52Z"
    message: Teleport resource has the Kubernetes origin label.
    reason: OriginLabelMatching
    status: "True"
    type: TeleportResourceOwned
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-25T17:08:58Z"
    message: 'Teleport returned the error: role my-non-existing-role is not found'
    reason: TeleportError
    status: "False"
    type: SuccessfullyReconciled
```

Here `SuccessfullyReconciled` is `False` and the error is `role my-non-existing-role is not found`.

If the status is not present or does not give sufficient information to solve
the issue, check the operator logs:

### The CR doesn't have a status

1. Check if the CR is in the same namespace as the operator. The operator only
   watches for resource in its own namespace.
2. Check if the operator pods are running and healthy:
   ```code
   kubectl get pods -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE"`
   ```
3. Check the operator logs:

   ```code
   $ kubectl logs deploy/<OPERATOR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME> -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE"
   ```

   <Note>
     In case of multi-replica deployments, only one operator instance is running
     the reconciliation loop. This operator is called the leader and is the only
     one producing reconciliation logs. The other operator instances are waiting
     with the following log:

     ```
     leaderelection.go:248] attempting to acquire leader lease teleport/431e83f4.teleport.dev...
     ```

     To diagnose reconciliation issues, you will have to inspect all pods to find
     the one reconciling the resources.
   </Note>

### I cannot delete the Kubernetes CR

The operator protects Kubernetes CRs from deletion with a finalizer.
It will not allow the CR to be deleted until the Teleport resource is deleted as
well, this is a safety to avoid leaving dangling resources and potentially grant
unintentional access.

There might be some reasons causing Teleport to refuse a resource deletion, the
most frequent one is if another resource depends on it. For example: you cannot
delete a role if it is still assigned to a user.

If this happens, the operator will report the error sent by Teleport in its log.

To resolve this lock, you can either:

- resolve the dependency issue so the resource gets successfully deleted in
  Teleport. In the role example, this would imply removing any mention of the
  role from the various users who had it.
- patch the Kubernetes CR to remove the finalizers. This will tell Kubernetes to
  stop waiting for the operator deletion and remove the CR. If you do this, the
  CR will be removed but the Teleport resource will remain. The operator will
  never attempt to remove it again.

  For example, if the role is named `my-role`:

  ```code
  kubectl patch TeleportRole my-role -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
  ```
