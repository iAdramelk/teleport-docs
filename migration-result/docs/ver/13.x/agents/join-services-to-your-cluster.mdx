A **Teleport service** manages access to resources in your infrastructure, such
as Kubernetes clusters, Windows desktops, internal web applications, and
databases. A single **Teleport process** can run multiple Teleport services.

There are multiple methods you can use to join a Teleport process to your
cluster in order to run Teleport services, including an instance of the Proxy
Service. Choose the method that best suits your infrastructure:

| Method                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                       | When to use                                                                     |

| [EC2 Identity Document](/docs/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/aws-ec2)        | A Teleport process running on an EC2 instance authenticates to your cluster via a signed EC2 instance identity document.                                          | Your Teleport process will run on EC2 and your Teleport cluster is self hosted. |
| [AWS IAM](/docs/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/aws-iam)                      | A Teleport process uses AWS credentials to join the cluster, whether running on EC2 or not.                                                                       | At least some of your infrastructure runs on AWS.                               |
| [Azure Managed Identity](/docs/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/azure)         | A Teleport process demonstrates that it runs in your Azure subscription by sending a signed attested data document and access token to the Teleport Auth Service. | Your Teleport process will run on Azure.                                        |
| [Kubernetes ServiceAccount](/docs/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/kubernetes) | A Teleport process uses a Kubernetes-signed proof to establish a trust relationship with your Teleport cluster.                                                   | Your Teleport process will run on Kubernetes.                                   |
| [GCP IAM](/docs/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/gcp)                          | A Teleport process uses a GCP-signed token to establish a trust relationship with your Teleport cluster.                                                          | Your Teleport process will run on a GCP VM.                                     |
| [Join Token](/docs/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token)                | A Teleport process presents a join token provided when starting the service.                                                                                      | There is no other supported method for your cloud provider.                     |
