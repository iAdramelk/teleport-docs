description: How to set up Teleport to protect internal apps and cloud provider APIs
version: '13.x'
---

Teleport is designed to provide secure access to cloud provider APIs and
internal applications. Examples include:

- The AWS management console.
- The `aws`, `gcloud`, `gsutil`, and `az` CLIs.
- Internal control panels.
- Tools, such as wikis, that are available only when connected to a VPN.
- Infrastructure dashboards, such as Kubernetes or Grafana.
- Developer tools, such as Jenkins, GitLab, or Opsgenie.

## Getting started

Learn how to register an application with Teleport in our [getting started
guide](/docs/ver/13.x/application-access/getting-started).

## Protect cloud provider APIs

You can use Teleport to provide secure access to your cloud provider's APIs.
This means that you can prevent unauthorized usage of management consoles and
CLI tools with the same RBAC system you use to protect your infrastructure.

  AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs with Teleport.

## Protect internal applications

You can use Teleport to enable secure access to internal applications. For
example, a load balancer might display network telemetry through a control panel
but might lack the ability to authenticate with and be accessed by resources
outside your private network.

Teleport lets team members access these resources securely, even outside a
private network, with no shared secrets.
