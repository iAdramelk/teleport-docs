In some cases, you will want to register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport
manually, rather than letting Teleport [discover the cluster
automatically](/docs/ver/13.x/kubernetes-access/discovery). There are a few ways to do this:

- [Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes
  Service with IAM Joining](/docs/ver/13.x/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/iam-joining) on your cluster of
  choice.
- Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes Service outside your Kubernetes cluster (e.g.,
  directly  on a virtual machine) and [give it access to a
  kubeconfig](/docs/ver/13.x/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/static-kubeconfig).
- Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes Service outside of Kubernetes  and [use dynamic
  configuration resources](/docs/ver/13.x/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/dynamic-registration) to
  register your clusters.
