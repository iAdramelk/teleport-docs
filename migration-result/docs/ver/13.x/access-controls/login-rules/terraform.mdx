This guide will explain how to:

- Use Teleport's Terraform Provider to deploy Login Rules to your Teleport cluster
- Edit deployed Login Rules via Terraform

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the Enterprise [Getting
      Started](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.4.16.
      You can download these tools by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).
      You can verify the tools you have installed by running the following commands:

      ```bash
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.4.16 go1.21

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.4.16 go1.21
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 14.3.6.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```bash
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v14.3.6 go1.21

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v14.3.6 go1.21
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Make sure you can connect to your Teleport cluster by authenticating with `tsh`
  so you can execute commands with the `tctl` admin tool:
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
      ```bash
      $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
      $ tctl status
      # Cluster  teleport.example.com
      # Version  13.4.16
      # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
      ```

      You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

      For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Teleport Auth
      Service host.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
      ```bash
      $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
      $ tctl status
      # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
      # Version  14.3.6
      # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
      ```

      You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

- [Terraform >= 1.0.0+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```bash
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v1.0.0
  ```

## Step 1/4. Set up Teleport credentials for Terraform

For simplicity, this guide will configure the Terraform provider to use your
current logged-in user's Teleport credentials obtained from `tsh login`.

<Note>
  The [Terraform provider guide](/docs/ver/13.x/management/dynamic-resources/terraform-provider)
  includes instructions for configuring a dedicated `terraform` user and role,
  which is a better option when running Terraform in a non-interactive
  environment.

  If you are already using Terraform to manage other resources in your Teleport
  cluster then you have probably already set up a `terraform` user and role and
  configured the associated credentials.
  Make sure to use the `terraform` role from the latest version of the guide,
  which has `list`, `read`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` verbs for
  `login_rule` resources.
</Note>

First, ensure you are logged into Teleport as a user that has permissions to
read and modify `login_rule` resources.
The preset `editor` role has access to this already, but in case you are using a
more customized configuration, create a role called `loginrule-manager.yaml`
with the following contents:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: loginrule-manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: [login_rule]
        verbs: [list, read, create, update, delete]
version: v6
```

Create the role with `tctl`:

```bash
$ tctl create loginrule-manager.yaml
role 'loginrule-manager' has been created
```

Assign the `loginrule-manager` role to your Teleport user by running the appropriate
commands for your authentication provider:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local User">
    1. Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
       ```

    2. Edit `out.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the list of existing roles:

       ```diff
         roles:
          - access
          - auditor
          - editor
       +  - loginrule-manager 
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f out.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    1. Retrieve your `github` authentication connector:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `github.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       github.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `github.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the `teams_to_roles` section.

       The team you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the team must include your user account and
       should be the smallest team possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         teams_to_roles:
           - organization: octocats
             team: admins
             roles:
               - access
       +       - loginrule-manager
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f github.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML">
    1. Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `saml.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       saml.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the `attributes_to_roles` section.

       The attribute you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your
       organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your
       user account and should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         attributes_to_roles:
           - name: "groups"
             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - loginrule-manager
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    1. Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

       ```bash
       $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
       ```

       Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key`
       to the `oidc.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the
       oidc.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

    2. Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `loginrule-manager` to the `claims_to_roles` section.

       The claim you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your organization's
       role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your user account and
       should be the smallest group possible within your organization.

       Here is an example:

       ```diff
         claims_to_roles:
           - name: "groups"
             value: "my-group"
             roles:
               - access
       +       - loginrule-manager
       ```

    3. Apply your changes:

       ```bash
       $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
       ```

    4. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/4. Create a Terraform configuration

Paste the following into a file called `main.tf` to configure the Terraform
provider and create two example Login Rules.
Make sure to update the `addr = "teleport.example.com:443"` field with the
public address of your Teleport Proxy.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = "~> 13.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  # Update addr to point to your Teleport proxy
  addr = "teleport.example.com:443"

  # Setting profile_dir and profile_name to empty strings will cause the
  # Terraform provider to authenticate using the current logged-in tsh profile
  profile_dir  = ""
  profile_name = ""
}

resource "teleport_login_rule" "terraform-test-map-rule" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "terraform-test-map-rule"
    description = "Terraform test rule using traits_map"
    labels = {
      example = "yes"
    }
  }
  version = "v1"

  # The rule with the lowest priority will be evaluated first.
  priority = 0

  # traits_map holds a map of all desired trait keys to list ofexpressions to
  # determine the trait values.
  traits_map = {

    # The "logins" traits will be set to the external "username" trait converted
    # to lowercase, as well as any external "logins" trait.
    "logins" = {

      # The traits_map value must be an object holding the expressions list in a
      # "values" field
      values = [
        "strings.lower(external.username)",
        "external.logins",
      ]
    }

    # The external "groups" trait will be passed through unchanged, all other
    # traits will be filtered out.
    "groups" = {
      values = [
        "external.groups",
      ]
    }
  }
}

resource "teleport_login_rule" "terraform-test-expression-rule" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "terraform-test-expression-rule"
    description = "Terraform test rule using traits_expression"
    labels = {
      example = "yes"
    }
  }
  version = "v1"

  # This rule has a higher priority value, so it will be evaluated after the
  # "terraform-test-map-rule".
  priority = 1

  # traits_expression is an alternative to traits_map, which returns all desired
  # traits in a single expression. The EOT syntax is a way of writing a
  # multiline string in Terraform, it is not part of the expression.
  traits_expression = <<-EOT
    external.put("groups",
      choose(
        option(external.groups.contains("admins"), external.groups.add("app-admins", "db-admins")),
        option(external.groups.contains("ops"), external.groups.add("k8s-admins")),
        option(true, external.groups)))
    EOT
}

```

## Step 3/4. Apply the configuration

Init Terraform and apply the configuration:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

## Step 4/4. Make sure everything worked

Double-check that the new Login Rules are now available in your cluster:

```bash
$ tctl get login_rules
kind: login_rule
metadata:
  description: Terraform test rule using traits_expression
  id: 1680190764978381000
  labels:
    example: "yes"
  name: terraform-test-expression-rule
spec:
  priority: 1
  traits_expression: |
    external.put("groups",
      choose(
        option(external.groups.contains("admins"),
external.groups.add("app-admins", "db-admins")),
        option(external.groups.contains("ops"),
external.groups.add("k8s-admins")),
        option(true, external.groups)))
version: v1
---
kind: login_rule
metadata:
  description: Terraform test rule using traits_map
  id: 1680193055097268000
  labels:
    example: "yes"
  name: terraform-test-map-rule
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_map:
    groups:
    - external.groups
    logins:
    - strings.lower(external.username)
    - external.logins
version: v1
```

Test the Login Rules you just installed with the `tctl login_rule test` command.
The `--load-from-cluster` flag tells the command to load all Login Rules
currently installed in the cluster.
You can send example traits to the standard input of the command, and it will
print the final traits after transformation by the Login Rules.

```bash
$ echo '{"groups": ["admins", "ops"], "username": ["Alice"], "logins": ["user", "root"]}' | \
  tctl login_rule test --load-from-cluster
groups:
- admins
- ops
- app-admins
- db-admins
logins:
- alice
- user
- root
```
