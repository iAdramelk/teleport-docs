title: Getting Started with Device Trust (Preview)
description: Get started with Teleport Device Trust
videoBanner: gBQyj_X1LVw
version: "13.x"
---

<Warning>
  Device Trust is currently in Preview mode and supports following components:

  - User devices: macOS and Windows.
  - Teleport client: `tsh` and Teleport connect.
  - Resources: SSH, Database and Kubernetes.

  Support for other operating systems, access from Web UI and application
  access is planned for upcoming Teleport versions.
</Warning>

Device Trust requires two of the following steps to have been configured:

- Device enforcement mode configured via either a role or a cluster-wide config.
- Trusted device registered and enrolled with Teleport.

In this guide, you will update an existing user profile to assign the preset `require-trusted-device`
role and then enroll a trusted device into Teleport to access a resource (a test linux server)
protected with Teleport.

- To enroll a macOS device, you need:
  - A signed and notarized `tsh` binary for enrollment.
    [Download the macOS tsh installer](/docs/ver/13.x/installation#macos).
  - A Teleport version newer than v12.0.0.
- To enroll a Windows device, you need:
  - A device that includes a TPM with 2.0 support.
  - `tsh` installed on the device. [Download the Windows tsh installer](/docs/ver/13.x/installation#windows-tsh-client-only).
  - Credentials for a user with administrator privileges for the device. This is only required during enrollment.
  - A Teleport version newer than v13.1.2.

- User with `editor` role.
  ```bash
  $ tsh status
  > Profile URL:      teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         disabled
  Valid until:        2023-08-22 03:30:24 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h52m0s]
  Extensions:         login-ip, permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy
  ```
- Access to a linux server (any Linux server you can access via `tsh ssh` will do).
  ```bash
  $ tsh ls
  Node Name        Address        Labels
  ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------------
  ip-172-31-35-170 ‚üµ Tunnel

  # test connection to ip-172-31-35-170
  $ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-35-170
  root@ip-172-31-35-170:~#
  ```

Once the above prerequisites are met, begin with the following step.

## Step 1/2. Update user profile to enforce Device Trust

To enforce Device Trust, a user must be assigned with a role with Device Trust mode "required".

For this guide, we will use the preset `require-trusted-device` role to update current user profile.

<Warning>
  <p>
    **v13.3.5 and Below**
  </p>

  The preset `require-trusted-device` role, as referenced in this guide, is only available
  from Teleport version 13.3.6 and above. For older Teleport cluster, you will need to update
  a role with `device_trust_mode: required`.

  <Accordion title="Update a role to enforce Device Trust">
    For simplicity, the example below updates the preset `access` role but you can update
    any existing access granting role which the user is assigned with to enforce Device Trust.

    First, fetch a role so you can update it locally:

    ```bash
    $ tctl edit role/access
    ```

    Edit the role with device trust mode:

    ```diff
    kind: role
    metadata:
      labels:
        teleport.internal/resource-type: preset
      name: access
    spec:
      allow:
        logins:
        - '{{internal.logins}}'
        ...
      options:
        # require authenticated device check for this role
    +   device_trust_mode: "required" # add this line
        ...
      deny:
        ...

    ```

    Save your edits.

    Now that the `access` role is configured with device mode "required", users with
    this role will be enforced with Device Trust.
  </Accordion>
</Warning>

First, let's fetch the user profile locally so we can update it with the preset `require-trusted-device` role.

```bash
$ tctl get users/myuser > myuser.yaml
```

Edit the profile:

```diff
kind: user
metadata:
  id: 1692716146877042322
  name: myuser
spec:
  created_by:
    time: "2023-08-14T13:42:22.291972449Z"
  expires: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  roles:
  - access
  - auditor
  - editor
+ - require-trusted-device # add this line
  status:
    is_locked: false
  ...
```

Save and update user:

```bash
$ tctl create -f myuser.yaml
```

Now that the user profile is updated to enforce Device Trust, try to access the test server
again.

```bash
$ tsh logout; tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-35-170
ERROR: access denied to root connecting to ip-172-31-35-170:0
```

As you can verify from the above step, access to `ip-172-31-35-170` ssh server,
which was previously accessible, is now forbidden.

## Step 2/2. Enroll device

To access `ip-172-31-35-170` server again, you will have to enroll your device.

Enrolling your device is easy, and can be done using `tsh` client:

```bash
$ tsh device enroll --current-device
Device "C00AA0AAAA0A"/macOS registered and enrolled
```

<Tip>
  <p>
    **self enrollment: v13.3.5+**
  </p>

  The `--current-device` flag tells `tsh` to enroll current device. User must have the preset `editor`
  or `device-admin` role to be able to self-enroll their device. For users without the `editor` or
  `device-admin` roles, an enrollment token must be generated by a device admin, which can then be
  used to enroll the device. Learn more about manual device enrollment in the
  [device management guide](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/device-trust/device-management#register-a-trusted-device)
</Tip>

Relogin to fetch updated certificate with device extension:

```bash
$ tsh logout; tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser

$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com:443
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor
  Logins:             root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2023-08-22 04:06:53 -0400 EDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         login-ip, ... teleport-device-asset-tag, teleport-device-credential-id, teleport-device-id
```

The presence of the `teleport-device-*` extensions shows that the device was successfully authenticated.

Now, let's try to access server (`ip-172-31-35-170`) again:

```bash
$ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-35-170
root@ip-172-31-35-170:~#
```

Congratulations! You have successfully configured a Trusted Device and accessed a resource protected with
Device Trust enforcement.

## Troubleshooting

### "binary missing signature or entitlements" on `tsh device enroll`

A signed and notarized `tsh` binary is necessary to enroll and use a a trusted
device. [Download the macOS tsh installer](/docs/ver/13.x/installation#macos) to fix
the problem.

### "unauthorized device" errors using a trusted device

A trusted device needs to be registered and enrolled before it is recognized by
Teleport as such. Follow the [registration](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/device-trust/device-management#register-a-trusted-device) and
[enrollment](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/device-trust/device-management#enroll-a-trusted-device) steps
and make sure to `tsh logout` and `tsh login` after enrollment is done.
