title: Jamf Pro Integration (Preview)
description: Sync your Jamf Pro inventory into Teleport
version: "13.x"
---

Device Trust Jamf Pro integration lets you automatically sync your Jamf Pro computer
inventory into Teleport.

The Teleport Jamf Pro service is a distinct `teleport` process that periodically
reads your computer inventory from Jamf Pro and syncs it to Teleport. It performs
both incremental (called "partial") and full syncs, as well as removals from
Teleport if a computer is removed from Jamf Pro.

Syncing devices from Jamf Pro is an **inventory management** step, equivalent to
automatically running the corresponding `tctl devices add` commands.

See the [Device Trust guide](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/device-trust) for fundamental Device Trust concepts
and behavior.

## Step 1/4. Create a Jamf user

Create a readonly Jamf user for inventory sync.

1. Access `https://yourtenant.jamfcloud.com/accounts.html`, replacing
   `yourtenant` with your Jamf Pro account.

2. Create a new Standard Account with the following settings:

   - Username: teleport (change as desired)
   - Access Level: Full Access
   - Privilege Set: Custom
   - Access Status: Enabled
   - Password: (a strong password of your choice)
   - Privileges:
     - Advanced Computer Searches: Read
     - Computers: Read

   Take note of the user and password created here for the next step.

   User account setup: <img src="/assets/jamf-setup-1-1befa868d6.png" alt="Jamf user setup" width="590" height="811" />

   Privileges setup: <img src="/assets/jamf-setup-2-4212d9e613.png" alt="Jamf privileges setup" width="1123" height="771" />

## Step 2/4. Configure Jamf service

<Tip>
  <p>
    **Hosted Jamf plugin**
  </p>

  Teleport Cloud users can quickly get started with Jamf integration by using
  the hosted Jamf plugin in the Web UI.

  <Accordion title="Configure Jamf hosted plugin">
    Select the Jamf plugin:
        <img src="/assets/select-jamf-739a18480c.png" alt="Select Jamf plugin" width="3192" height="1436" />
    Fill in the required information and click "Connect Jamf" button:
        <img src="/assets/hosted-jamf-8796805fa4.png" alt="Configure Jamf plugin" width="3164" height="1328" />
  </Accordion>
</Tip>

Jamf inventory sync is performed by a separate `teleport` process, configured
using the `jamf_service` key. It is recommended to run the service isolated from
other Teleport processes, as it requires the Jamf credentials created in the
step above.

Save the following file as `/var/lib/teleport.yaml` and edit as needed:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  # Necessary to write devices back to Teleport.
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443 # CHANGEME
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"

jamf_service:
  enabled: true
  name: jamf
  api_endpoint: https://yourtenant.jamfcloud.com # CHANGEME
  username: teleport                             # CHANGEME
  password_file: /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password.txt

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: false
```

Change the following settings, as appropriate:

- teleport.proxy\_server
- jamf\_service.api\_endpoint
- jamf\_service.username

Finally, write your Jamf password to the `/var/lib/teleport/jamf_password` file:

```bash
$ sudo nano /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password # or use your favorite editor

# Only the OS user that runs `teleport` should have access to the password file.
$ sudo chmod 400 /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password
$ sudo chown teleport /var/lib/teleport/jamf_password
```

## Step 3/4. Create a join token

Jamf service requires an MDM token to write devices to Teleport.
On your local workstation, create the token as shown below:

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=mdm
The invite token: efgh456-insecure-do-not-use-this
This token will expire in 30 minutes.

From the Jamf service host, use this token to add an MDM service to Teleport.

> teleport start \
   --token=efgh456-insecure-do-not-use-this \
   --ca-pin=sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678\
   --config=/path/to/teleport.yaml
```

On the Jamf service host, write the token to a file called `/tmp/token`.

## Step 4/4. Start Jamf service

Using the token created above, start the service:

Configure your Teleport instance to start automatically when the host boots up by
creating a systemd service for it. The instructions depend on how you installed
your Teleport instance.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Package Manager">
    On the host where you will run your Teleport instance, enable and start Teleport:

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TAR Archive">
    On the host where you will run your Teleport instance, create a systemd service
    configuration for Teleport, enable the Teleport service, and start Teleport:

    ```bash
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of your Teleport instance with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

The initial sync should happen in a few minutes. You can confirm from the Teleport service logs:

```
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Jamf service successfully started pid:25757.1 service/service.go:228
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Starting sync CutTime:0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC FilterRSQL: Mode:1 OnMissing:DELETE pid:25757.1 service/service.go:261
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Device sync report, page #0 deletes:0 failures:0 pid:25757.1 upserts:1 service/service.go:666
2023-06-21T17:26:40-03:00 INFO [JAMF:1]    Sync complete pid:25757.1 service/service.go:277
```

Using the default configuration, the service will sync devices from Jamf every
few hours. Once a day a full inventory sync is performed, enumerating all
devices from Jamf and reflecting any additions or removals on Teleport.

After the initial sync happens, you may verify the synced devices using `tctl
devices ls`:

```bash
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag    OS      Enroll Status Device ID
------------ ------- ------------- ------------------------------------
CXXXXXXXXX17 macOS   not enrolled  20ec6373-9e8e-46e0-8f1c-47ad6b06a768

CXXXXXXXXX5T macOS   not enrolled  bf189863-a94a-40dc-9013-d96f8dada2f1
(...)
```

## Optional: Customize the sync schedule

When using the minimal configuration, described in the steps above, Jamf service
utilizes a default sync schedule. It is possible to customize sync intervals, as
well as the set of devices synced from Jamf, by applying RSQL filters provided
by the [Jamf Pro API](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/reference/get_v1-computers-inventory).
Jamf recommends a full sync no more than once every 24 hours.

The default "inventory" configuration is roughly equivalent to the one below:

```yaml
jamf_service:
  enabled: true
  # ...
  inventory:
  - sync_period_partial: 6h
    sync_period_full: 24h
    on_missing: DELETE
    filter_rsql: general.remoteManagement.managed==true
```

Unpacking the configuration, we have the following keys:

### `sync_period_*`

- `sync_period_partial`: period for partial syncs. A partial sync attempts to
  fetch new and modified devices, but won't scan the entire Jamf inventory.
- `sync_period_full`: period for full syncs. A full sync scans the entire Jamf
  inventory, processing new/modified devices and removals from Jamf.

Both sync periods may be disabled by setting the period to `0` or `-1`. It is
recommended to do a full sync with some regularity, so Teleport has the chance
to fully synchronize both inventories.

### `on_missing`

The `on_missing` key determines what to do with devices deleted from Jamf, but
present in Teleport. The possible actions are:

- `DELETE`: devices removed from Jamf are eventually removed from Teleport.
  (Requires a full sync.)
- `NOOP`: devices removed from Jamf are allowed to remain in the Teleport
  inventory.

Only devices synced by Jamf are susceptible to deletion in this manner. Devices
written manually via `tctl devices add` or written by other sources won't be
deleted.

For immediate removal of unwanted devices first lock the device on Teleport,
then remove it from Jamf:

```bash
$ tctl devices lock --asset-tag=SERIAL_NUMBER --message='reason for locking'
Created a lock with name "a2f1491c-4a3e-4daf-9c83-2fe931668076".
```

Manual removal via `tctl devices rm` is possible, but note that if the device is
still in the Jamf inventory, it'll be recreated during the next sync.

### `filter_rsql`

The `filter_rsql` key applies a Jamf Pro API filter when querying for devices.
Refer to
[https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/reference/get\_v1-computers-inventory](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/reference/get_v1-computers-inventory) for the
possible filter values.

## Optional: Sync multiple sources

When syncing inventory, Jamf service claims ownership of all synced devices.
This can be verified by inspecting a device's `source` field:

```yaml
# tctl get device/mydevice
kind: device
metadata:
  name: 20ec6373-9e8e-46e0-8f1c-47ad6b06a768
spec:
  asset_tag: mydevice
  os_type: macos
  # ...
  source:         # Set during inventory sync
    name: jamf    # Copied from jamf_service.name
    origin: jamf  # Always "jamf" for Jamf service
  update_time: "2023-06-21T19:44:40.40601Z"
version: v1
```

Device ownership is important in a few situations, but it is particularly
important when running "on\_missing=DELETE" syncs, as only the devices owned by
the sync source are considered for deletion.

If you want to run multiple Jamf sources you can simply run multiple Jamf
services, each with its configuration and credentials. Just make sure that each
service has a different "jamf\_service.name". For example:

`teleport.yaml` - Service #1:

```diff
version: v3
teleport:
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443

jamf_service:
  enabled: true
+ name: jamf1
+ api_endpoint: https://tenant1.jamfcloud.com
+ username: tenant1
+ password_file: /var/lib/teleport/jamf1_password.txt

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: false
```

`teleport.yaml` - Service #2:

```diff
version: v3
teleport:
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443

jamf_service:
  enabled: true
+ name: jamf2
+ api_endpoint: https://tenant2.jamfcloud.com
+ username: tenant2
+ password_file: /var/lib/teleport/jamf2_password.txt

auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false

ssh_service:
  enabled: false
```
