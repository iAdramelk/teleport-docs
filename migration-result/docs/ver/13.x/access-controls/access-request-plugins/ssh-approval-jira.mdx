version: "13.x"
---

This guide will talk through how to set up Teleport with Jira. Teleport's Jira
integration allows you to treat Teleport access and permission requests using
Jira tickets.

<Accordion title="This integration is hosted on Teleport Cloud">
  In Teleport Team and Teleport Enterprise Cloud, Teleport manages the Jira integration for
  you, and you can enroll the Jira integration from the Teleport Web UI.

  Visit the Teleport Web UI and find the dropdown menu on the upper left of the
  screen. Select the **Management** option.

  On the left sidebar, click **Enroll New Integration** to visit the "Enroll New
  Integration" page:

    <img src="/assets/enroll-7cf5756f5a.png" alt="Enroll an Access Request plugin" width="2560" height="1440" />

  On the "Select Integration Type" menu, click the tile for your integration. You
  will see a page with instructions to set up the integration, as well as a form
  that you can use to configure the integration.
</Accordion>

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the Enterprise [Getting
      Started](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.4.16.
      You can download these tools by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).
      You can verify the tools you have installed by running the following commands:

      ```bash
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.4.16 go1.21

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.4.16 go1.21
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 14.3.6.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```bash
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v14.3.6 go1.21

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v14.3.6 go1.21
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Jira Server or Jira Cloud installation with an owner privileges, specifically
  to set up webhooks, issue types, and workflows
- Make sure you can connect to your Teleport cluster by authenticating with `tsh`
  so you can execute commands with the `tctl` admin tool:
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
      ```bash
      $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
      $ tctl status
      # Cluster  teleport.example.com
      # Version  13.4.16
      # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
      ```

      You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

      For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Teleport Auth
      Service host.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
      ```bash
      $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
      $ tctl status
      # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
      # Version  14.3.6
      # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
      ```

      You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

## Step 1/6. Create a user and role for access

Teleport's Access Request plugins authenticate to your Teleport cluster as a
user with permissions to list, read, and update Access Requests. This way,
plugins can retrieve Access Requests from the Teleport Auth Service, present
them to reviewers, and modify them after a review.

Define a user and role called `access-plugin` by adding the following content to
a file called `access-plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read', 'update']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
---
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
```

Create the user and role:

```bash
$ tctl create -f access-plugin.yaml
```

As with all Teleport users, the Teleport Auth Service authenticates the
`access-plugin` user by issuing short-lived TLS credentials. In this case, we
will need to request the credentials manually by *impersonating* the
`access-plugin` role and user.

If you are running a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployment and are using
`tctl` from the Auth Service host, you will already have impersonation
privileges.

To grant your user impersonation privileges for `access-plugin`, define a role
called `access-plugin-impersonator` by pasting the following YAML document into
a file called `access-plugin-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: access-plugin-impersonator
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
```

Create the `access-plugin-impersonator` role:

```bash
$ tctl create -f access-plugin-impersonator.yaml
```

Retrieve your user definition:

```bash
$ TELEPORT_USER=$(tsh status --format=json | jq -r .active.username)
$ tctl get users/${TELEPORT_USER?} > myuser.yaml
```

Edit `myuser.yaml` to include the role you just created:

```diff
  roles:
   - access
   - auditor
   - editor
+  - access-plugin-impersonator
```

Apply your changes:

```bash
$ tctl create -f myuser.yaml
```

Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again. You will now be able to
generate signed certificates for the `access-plugin` role and user.

## Step 2/6. Export the access-plugin certificate

Like all Teleport users, `access-plugin` needs signed credentials in
order to connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign`
command to request these credentials for your plugin.

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `access-plugin` user,
generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```bash
$ tctl auth sign --user=access-plugin --out=auth.pem
```

The plugin connects to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `auth.pem`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. The plugin
uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service, which establishes a
reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The plugin uses this reverse
tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the Auth Service's gRPC
endpoint.

You will refer to this file later when configuring the plugin.

<Note>
  <p>
    **Certificate Lifetime**
  </p>

  By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
  lifetime. For production deployments, we suggest using [Machine
  ID](/docs/ver/13.x/machine-id/introduction) to programmatically issue and renew
  certificates for your plugin. See our Machine ID [getting started
  guide](/docs/ver/13.x/machine-id/getting-started) to learn more.

  Note that you cannot issue certificates that are valid longer than your existing credentials.
  For example, to issue certificates with a 1000-hour TTL, you must be logged in with a session that is
  valid for at least 1000 hours. This means your user must have a role allowing
  a `max_session_ttl` of at least 1000 hours, and you must specify a `--ttl`
  when logging in:

  ```bash
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --ttl=1001h
  ```
</Note>

We'll reference these files later when configuring the plugin.

## Step 3/6. Set up your Jira project

### Create the permission management project

All new permission requests are going to show up in a project you choose. We recommend that you create a separate project for permissions management, and a new board in said project.

You'll need the project Jira key to configure the plugin.

### Set up the status board

Create a new board for tasks in the permission management project. The board has to have at least these three columns:

- Pending
- Approved
- Denied

Teleport's Jira plugin will create a new issue for each new permission request in the first available column on the board. When you drag the request task to the Approved column in Jira, the request will be approved. If you drag the request task to the Denied column in Jira, the request will be denied.

### Get your Jira API token

If you're using Jira Cloud, navigate to [Account Settings → Security → API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and create a new app specific API token in your Jira installation. You'll need this token later to configure the plugin.

For Jira Server, the URL of the API tokens page will be different depending on your installation.

### Set up Jira webhooks

Go to Settings → General → System → Webhooks and create a new webhook for Jira to tell the Teleport plugin about updates.

For the webhook URL, use the URL that you'll run the plugin on. It needs to be a publicly accessible URL (we will show you how to set this up later). Jira requires the webhook listener to run over HTTPS.

The webhook needs to be notified only about new issues being created, issues being updated, or deleted. You can leave all the other boxes empty.

<Note>
  <p>
    **Plugin Defaults**
  </p>

  Jira will send updates about any issues in any projects in your Jira installation to the webhook. We suggest that you use JQL filters to limit which issues are being sent to the plugin.

  The plugin's web server will run with TLS, but you can disable it with `--insecure-no-tls` to test things out in a dev environment.
</Note>

In the webhook settings page, make sure that the webhook will only send Issue Updated updates. It's not critical if anything else gets sent, since the plugin will just ignore everything else.

## Step 4/6. Install the plugin

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Download">
    We currently only provide `linux-amd64` binaries. You can also compile these
    plugins from source. You can run the plugin from a remote host or your local
    development machine.

    ```bash
    $ curl -L -O https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-jira-v13.3.8-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf teleport-access-jira-v13.3.8-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    $ cd teleport-access-jira
    $ sudo ./install
    ```

    Make sure the binary is installed:

    ```bash
    $ teleport-jira version
    teleport-jira v13.3.8 git:teleport-jira-v13.3.8-fffffffff go1.21
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Docker Image">
    We currently only provide Docker images for `linux-amd64`.
    Pull the Docker image for the latest access request plugin by running the following command:

    ```bash
    $ docker pull public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-jira:13.3.8
    ```

    Make sure the plugin is installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    $ docker run public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-jira:13.3.8 version
    teleport-jira v13.3.8 git:teleport-jira-v13.3.8-fffffffff 1.21
    ```

    For a list of available tags, visit [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-jira).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From Source">
    To install from source you need `git` and `go` installed. If you do not have Go
    installed, visit the Go [downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
    $ cd teleport-plugins/access/jira
    $ make
    ```

    Move the `teleport-jira` binary into your PATH.

    Make sure the binary is installed:

    ```bash
    $ teleport-jira version
    teleport-jira v13.3.8 git:teleport-jira-v13.3.8-fffffffff go1.21
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    {/*TODO: Replace this with the following partial once we fix
    gravitational/docs#299:
    docs/pages/kubernetes-access/helm/includes/helm-repo-add.mdx*/}

    Allow Helm to install charts that are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository:

    ```bash
    $ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
    ```

    Update the cache of charts from the remote repository:

    ```bash
    $ helm repo update
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5/6. Configure the plugin

Depending on whether you are running the plugin as an executable in a
non-containerized environment or on Kubernetes, follow the appropriate
instructions for your environment to configure the plugin:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable">
    The Teleport Jira plugin uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a
    boilerplate config by running the following command:

    ```bash
    $ teleport-jira configure > teleport-jira.toml
    $ sudo mv teleport-jira.toml /etc
    ```

    By default, the Jira Teleport plugin will use a config in
    `/etc/teleport-jira.toml`, and you can override it with `-c
    config/file/path.toml` flag.

    The configuration file will resemble the following:

    ```toml
    # example jira plugin configuration TOML file
    [teleport]
    auth_server = "myinstance.teleport.sh:443"             # Teleport Cloud proxy HTTPS address
    identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/jira/auth.pem"   # Teleport identity file location

    [jira]
    url = "https://example.com/jira"    # JIRA URL. For JIRA Cloud, https://[my-jira].atlassian.net
    username = "bot@example.com"        # JIRA username
    api_token = "token"                 # JIRA API Basic Auth token
    project = "MYPROJ"                  # JIRA Project key

    [http]
    # listen_addr = ":8081" # Network address in format [addr]:port on which webhook server listens, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443
    # public_addr = "example.com" # URL on which webhook server is accessible externally, e.g. [https://]teleport-jira.example.com
    https_key_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/jira/server.key"  # TLS private key
    https_cert_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/jira/server.crt" # TLS certificate

    [log]
    output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/jira.log"
    severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    Create a file called `values.yaml` with the following content, which configures
    the Helm chart for the plugin. It should resemble the following:

    ```yaml
    teleport:
      # Teleport HTTPS Proxy web address, for Teleport Enterprise Cloud should be in the form "your-account.teleport.sh:443"
      address: "teleport.example.com:443"
      # Secret containing identity
      identitySecretName: teleport-plugin-jira-identity

    jira:
      url: https://jira.example.com/  # URL of the Jira instance
      username: bot@example.com       # Email of the bot user
      apiToken: token                 # Token of the bot user
      project: MYPROJ                 # Project where issues will be created

    http:
      publicAddress: https://jira-teleport.example.com/  # Publicly available
      tlsFromSecret: teleport-plugin-jira-tls            # Secret containing the TLS certificate
      # tlsKeySecretPath:  tls.key                       # Name of the key inside the secret
      # tlsCertSecretPath: tls.crt                       # Name of the certificate inside the secret

    log:
      output: stderr  # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/jira.log"
      severity: INFO  # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".

    ```

    Use the following command to create the Kubernetes secret referenced in the
    values file from the identity file you generated earlier:

    ```console
    kubectl create secret generic teleport-plugin-jira-identity --from-file=auth_id=auth.pem
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `[teleport]` sections includes configuration options for connecting the Jira
plugin to Teleport.

The `[jira]` section requires a few things:

- Your Jira Cloud or Jira Server URL. For Jira Cloud, it looks something like `yourcompany.atlassian.net`.
- Your username on Jira, i.e. [ben@goteleport.com](mailto:ben@goteleport.com)
- Your Jira API token that you've created above.
- A Jira Project key, available in Project settings.

The `[http]` setting block describes how the plugin's HTTP server works. The HTTP server is responsible for listening for updates from Jira, and processing updates, like when someone drags a task from Inbox to Approved column.

You must provide an address the server should listen on, and a certificate to use. It's possible to
run the Jira plugin on the same server as the Teleport Proxy, so you can use the same TLS certificate.

## Step 6/6. Test the plugin

You should be able to run the Teleport plugin now!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Executable">
    ```bash
    $ teleport-jira start
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    ```bash
    $ helm install teleport-plugin-jira teleport/teleport-plugin-jira \
      --values teleport-jira-helm.yaml \
      --version 13.3.8
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The log output should look familiar to what Teleport service logs. You should see that it connected to Teleport, and is listening for new Teleport requests and Jira webhooks.

Go ahead and test it:

```bash
$ tsh login --request-roles=admin
```

That should create a new permission request on Teleport (you can test if it did with `tctl request ls`), and you should see a new task on your Jira project board.

### Set up systemd

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init system like systemd.
Here's the recommended Teleport plugin service unit file for systemd:

```txt
[Unit]
Description=Teleport Jira Plugin
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/teleport-jira start --config=/etc/teleport-jira.toml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/teleport-jira.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save this as `teleport-jira.service`. Make sure the `teleport-jira start` command includes a `--config` flag that refers to the configuration file you created earlier.

## Audit log

The plugin will let anyone with access to the Jira board approve/deny requests so it's
important to review Teleport's audit log.

## Next steps

To see all of the options available to you when using the Helm chart for the
Teleport Jira plugin, consult our [reference
guide](/docs/ver/13.x/reference/helm-reference/teleport-plugin-jira).
