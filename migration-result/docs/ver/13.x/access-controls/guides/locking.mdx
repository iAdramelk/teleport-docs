title: Session and Identity Locking
description: How to lock compromised users or agents
version: '13.x'
---

<Accordion title="Version warning">
  Locking support was introduced in Teleport v7.1. To fully enforce the locks
  at all components, you should update **all** `teleport` binaries in your
  deployment.
</Accordion>

System administrators can disable a compromised user or Teleport agent—or
prevent access during cluster maintenance—by placing a lock
on a session, user or host identity.

Teleport will reject new API requests and terminate active
connections to SSH, database, desktop, and Kubernetes sessions
matching the lock's target.

A lock can target the following objects or attributes:

- a Teleport user by the user's name
- a Teleport [RBAC](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/reference) role by the role's name
- a Teleport [trusted device](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/device-trust/guide#optional-locking-a-device) by the device ID
- an MFA device by the device's UUID
- an OS/UNIX login
- a Teleport agent by the agent's server UUID (effectively unregistering it from the
  cluster)
- a Windows desktop by the desktop's name
- an [Access Request](/docs/ver/13.x/access-controls/access-requests) by UUID

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open Source">
    - A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our
      [Getting Started](/docs/ver/13.x/index) guide.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```

      See [Installation](/docs/ver/13.x/installation) for details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0,
      which you can download by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```code

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/2. Create a lock

You can create a new lock with the `tctl lock` command. Specify the lock target
with one of the following options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Username">
    ```code
    $ tctl lock --user=foo@example.com --message="Suspicious activity." --ttl=10h
    # Created a lock with name "dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Role">
    All users with assigned roles matching the target role will be locked.

    ```code
    $ tctl lock --role=contractor --message="All contractor access is disabled for 10h." --ttl=10h
    # Created a lock with name "dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Trusted device">
    All connections initiated from a device matching the device ID will be locked.

    ```code
    $ tctl lock --device 9cdfc0ad-64b7-4d9c-9342-50e97f418ba0 --message="Compromised device" --ttl=48h
    Created a lock with name "5444970a-39a0-4814-968d-e58b4a8fa686".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-factor device">
    All connections initiated with per-session MFA matching the device ID will be locked.

    ```code
    $ tctl lock --mfa-device=d6c06a18-e147-4232-9dfe-6f83a28d5850 --message="All contractor access is disabled for 10h." --ttl=10h
    # Created a lock with name "d6c06a18-e147-4232-9dfe-6f83a28d5850".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Agent">
    All connections to the specified agent will be locked and the agent will be excluded from the Teleport cluster.

    ```code
    $ tctl lock --server-id=363256df-f78a-4d99-803c-bae19da9ede4 --message="The server running the Kubernetes Service and Database Service is under investigation." --ttl=10h
    # Created a lock with name "dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows Desktop">
    All connections to the specified Windows Desktop will be locked.

    ```code
    $ tctl lock --windows-desktop=WIN-FMPFM5UF1SS-teleport-example-com --ttl=10h
    # Created a lock with name "dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1".
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Access request">
    All connections using elevated privileges from the matching Access Request will be locked.

    ```code
    $ tctl lock --access-request=261e80c5-357b-4c43-9b67-40a6bc4c6e4d --ttl=24h
    # Created a lock with name "dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1".
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting: failed to create a lock?">
  If your user is missing a lock permission, you will get an error when creating
  a lock:

  ```txt
  ERROR: access denied to perform action "create" on "lock"
  ```

  Create a role `locksmith`:

  ```yaml
  kind: role
  version: v5
  metadata:
    name: locksmith
  spec:
    allow:
      rules:
        - resources: [lock]
          verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
  ```

  ```code
  $ tctl create -f locksmith.yaml
  # role 'locksmith' has been created
  ```

  Assign the `locksmith` role to your Teleport user by running the following
  commands, depending on whether you authenticate as a local Teleport user or via
  the `github`, `saml`, or `oidc` authentication connectors:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Local User">
      Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

      ```code
      $ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
      ```

      Edit `out.yaml`, adding `locksmith` to the list of existing roles:

      ```diff
        roles:
         - access
         - auditor
         - editor
      +  - locksmith
      ```

      Apply your changes:

      ```code
      $ tctl create -f out.yaml
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="GitHub">
      Retrieve your `github`  configuration resource:

      ```code
      $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
      ```

      Edit `github.yaml`, adding `locksmith` to the
      `teams_to_roles` section. The team you will map to this role will depend on how
      you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest team
      possible within your organization. This team must also include your user.

      Here is an example:

      ```diff
        teams_to_roles:
          - organization: octocats
            team: admins
            roles:
              - access
      +       - locksmith
      ```

      Apply your changes:

      ```code
      $ tctl create -f github.yaml
      ```

      <Warning>
        Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
        `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `github.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
        so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
      </Warning>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="SAML">
      Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

      ```code
      $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
      ```

      Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `locksmith` to the
      `attributes_to_roles` section. The attribute you will map to this role will
      depend on how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the
      smallest group possible within your organization. This group must also include
      your user.

      Here is an example:

      ```diff
        attributes_to_roles:
          - name: "groups"
            value: "my-group"
            roles:
              - access
      +       - locksmith
      ```

      Apply your changes:

      ```code
      $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
      ```

      <Warning>
        Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
        `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `saml.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
        so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
      </Warning>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="OIDC">
      Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

      ```code
      $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
      ```

      Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `locksmith` to the
      `claims_to_roles` section. The claim you will map to this role will depend on
      how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest
      group possible within your organization. This group must also include your
      user.

      Here is an example:

      ```diff
        claims_to_roles:
          - name: "groups"
            value: "my-group"
            roles:
              - access
      +       - locksmith
      ```

      Apply your changes:

      ```code
      $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
      ```

      <Warning>
        Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
        `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `oidc.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
        so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
      </Warning>
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again to assume the new role.
</Accordion>

With a lock in force, all established connections involving the lock's target
get terminated while any new requests are rejected.

Errors returned and warnings logged in this situation feature a message of the
form:

```
lock targeting User:"foo@example.com" is in force: Suspicious activity.
```

<Note>
  You can tweak the message returned to a user with `--message` parameter:

  ```code
  $ tctl lock --user=foo@example.com --message="Please come back tomorrow." --ttl=24h
  ```
</Note>

<Accordion title="Under the hood: Lock resource and expiration">
  Note that without specifying `--ttl` or `--expires`, the created lock remains in
  force until explicitly removed with `tctl rm`.  Refer to `tctl lock --help` for
  the list of all supported parameters.

  Under the hood, `tctl lock` creates a resource:

  ```yaml
  kind: lock
  version: v2
  metadata:
    name: dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1
  spec:
    target:
      user: foo@example.com
    message: "Suspicious activity."
    expires: "2021-08-14T22:27:00Z"  # RFC3339 format
  ```

  The `kind: lock` resources can also be created and updated using `tctl create`
  as per usual. See the [Admin Guide](/docs/ver/13.x/reference/resources) for more
  details.
</Accordion>

## Step 2/2. List and delete active locks

Use `tctl get` command to list all active locks:

```code
$ tctl get locks
```

Delete a lock resource:

```code
$ tctl rm locks/24679348-baff-4987-a2cd-e820ab7f9d2b
lock "24679348-baff-4987-a2cd-e820ab7f9d2b" has been deleted
```

Deleting a lock will allow new sessions or host connections.

## Next steps: Locking modes

If a Teleport Node or Proxy Service cannot properly synchronize its local lock
view with the backend, there is a decision to be made about whether to rely on
the last known locks. This decision strategy is encoded as one of the two modes:

- `strict` mode causes all interactions to be terminated when the locks are not
  guaranteed to be up to date
- `best_effort` mode keeps relying on the most recent locks

The cluster-wide mode defaults to `best_effort`. You can set up the default
locking mode via API or CLI using a `cluster_auth_preference` resource or static
configuration file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API or CLI">
    Create a YAML file called `cap.yaml` or get the existing file using
    `tctl get cap`.

    ```yaml
    kind: cluster_auth_preference
    metadata:
      name: cluster-auth-preference
    spec:
      locking_mode: best_effort
    version: v2
    ```

    Create a resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f cap.yaml
    # cluster auth preference has been updated
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Static Config">
    Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the Auth Server:

    ```yaml
    auth_service:
        authentication:
            locking_mode: best_effort
    ```

    Restart the Auth Server for the change to take effect.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The cluster-wide mode defaults to `best_effort`. You can set up the default
locking mode via API or CLI using a `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

Create a YAML file called `cap.yaml` or get the existing file using
`tctl get cap`.

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  locking_mode: best_effort
version: v2
```

Create a resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
# cluster auth preference has been updated
```

It is also possible to configure the locking mode for a particular role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
    name: example-role-with-strict-locking
spec:
    options:
       lock: strict
```

When none of the roles involved in an interaction specify the mode or when
there is no user involved, the mode is taken from the cluster-wide setting.

With multiple potentially conflicting locking modes (the cluster-wide default
and the individual per-role settings) a single occurrence of `strict` suffices
for the local lock view to become evaluated strictly.
