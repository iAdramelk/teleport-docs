title: Teleport Configuration Reference
description: The detailed guide and reference documentation for configuring Teleport for SSH and Kubernetes access.
keywords: [config, file, reference, yaml, etc]
tocDepth: 3
version: "13.x"
---

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration
reference file is shown below. This provides comments and all available options
for `teleport.yaml`.

By default, Teleport reads its configuration from `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

## Before using this reference

<Note>
  Do not use this example configuration in production.
</Note>

You must edit your configuration file to meet the needs of your environment.
Using a copy of the reference configuration will have unintended effects. To
create a configuration file that you can use as a starting point, run the
following command:

```bash
$ teleport configure -o file
```

There are also `configure` commands available for the SSH Service and Database
Service. See our documentation on `teleport node configure` and `teleport db
configure` in the [Teleport CLI Reference](/docs/ver/13.x/reference/cli/teleport).

<Warning>
  You should back up your configuration file before making changes. This will
  enable you to roll back to the previous configuration if you need to.
</Warning>

## Enabling Teleport services

The `teleport` process can run multiple services.

For some services, you must enable the service within your Teleport
configuration in order to start it. Other services are enabled by default.

To enable or disable a service, include the following in your Teleport
configuration, replacing `service_name` with the name of your service (service
names are listed below):

```yaml
service_name:
  enabled: "no"
```

Teleport supports the following services:

| Service             | Configuration section     | Enabled by default |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Application Service | `app_service`             | ❌                  |
| Auth Service        | `auth_service`            | ✅                  |
| Database Service    | `db_service`              | ❌                  |
| Discovery Service   | `discovery_service`       | ❌                  |
| Kubernetes Service  | `kubernetes_service`      | ❌                  |
| Proxy Service       | `proxy_service`           | ✅                  |
| SSH Service         | `ssh_service`             | ✅                  |
| Desktop Service     | `windows_desktop_service` | ❌                  |
| Okta Service        | `okta_service`            | ❌                  |
| Jamf Service        | `jamf_service`            | ❌                  |

Teleport Cloud manages the Auth Service and Proxy Service for you. Instances of
Teleport services (e.g., the Application Service and Database Service) should
include the following configuration options to avoid unintended effects:

```yaml
auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Reference configurations

These example configurations include all possible configuration options in YAML
format to demonstrate proper use of indentation.

### Instance-wide settings

These settings apply to any `teleport` instance:

```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# Configuration file version. The current version is "v3".
version: v3

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows one to assign an alternative name this node can be
    # reached by. By default it's equal to hostname.
    nodename: graviton

    # Data directory where Teleport daemon keeps its data.
    # See "Storage backends" for more details
    # (https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/backends/).
    data_dir: /var/lib/teleport

    # PID file for Teleport process
    #pid_file: /var/run/teleport.pid

    # The invitation token or an absolute path to a file containing the token used
    # to join a cluster. It is not used on subsequent starts.
    # If using a file, it only needs to exist when teleport is first ran.
    #
    # File path example:
    # auth_token: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
    #
    # This is the same as setting join_params.method to "token", and join_params.token_name
    # to the value of auth_token.
    # You should only use either auth_token or join_params.
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # join_params are parameters to set when joining a cluster via
    # EC2, IAM or a token.
    #
    # EC2 join method documentation:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws-ec2/
    # IAM join method documentation:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws-iam/
    join_params:
        # When `method` is set to "token", it is the equivalent to using `auth_token` above.
        # You should only use either auth_token or join_params.
        method: "token"|"ec2"|"iam"|"github"|"circleci"|"kubernetes"

        # If method is not "token", token_name will be will be the name of
        # the joining token resource, e.g., "ec2-token" or "iam-token" as created
        # in the Joining Nodes via EC2 or IAM guides.

        # If method is "token", token_name will be the invitation token
        # or an absolute path to a file containing the token used to join a cluster.
        # It is not used on subsequent starts.
        # If using a file, it only needs to exist when teleport is first ran.
        #
        # File path example:
        # token_name: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
        token_name: "token-name"

    # Optional CA pin of the Auth Service. Specifying a CA pin enables new
    # agents to trust a Teleport cluster when joining via the Auth Service
    # directly. You can assign the ca_pin field to the literal value of the CA
    # pin or an absolute path to a file. If you specify a file, the file should
    # only contain the CA pin.
    #
    # You can also specify the value of the ca_pin key as a YAML list of CA pins
    # or file paths, e.g.:
    #
    # ca_pin:
    #   - /var/lib/teleport/pin1
    #   - /var/lib/teleport/pin2
    #
    # See the documentation on using CA pins:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/management/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token/#connecting-directly-to-the-auth-service.
    ca_pin:
      "sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1"

    # When running in multi-homed or NATed environments Teleport Nodes need
    # to know which IP it will be reachable at by other Nodes.
    #
    # This value can be specified as FQDN e.g. host.example.com
    advertise_ip: 10.1.0.5

    # Teleport provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring purposes. They are
    # disabled by default but you can enable them using the diagnosis address.
    # See the Teleport metrics reference:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/management/diagnostics/metrics/
    diag_addr: "127.0.0.1:3000"

    # Only use one of auth_server or proxy_server.
    #
    # When you have either the application service or database service enabled,
    # only tunneling through the proxy is supported, so you should specify proxy_server.
    # All other services support both tunneling through the proxy and directly connecting
    # to the auth server, so you can specify either auth_server or proxy_server.

    # Auth Server address and port to connect to. If you enable the Teleport
    # Auth Server to run in High Availability configuration, the address should
    # point to a Load Balancer.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL (e.g. teleport-proxy.example.com:443)
    # and set `proxy_server` instead.
    auth_server: 10.1.0.5:3025

    # Proxy Server address and port to connect to. If you enable the Teleport
    # Proxy Server to run in High Availability configuration, the address should
    # point to a Load Balancer.
    proxy_server: teleport-proxy.example.com:443

    # cache:
    #  # The cache is enabled by default, it can be disabled with this flag
    #  enabled: true

    # Teleport throttles all connections to avoid abuse. These settings allow
    # you to adjust the default limits
    connection_limits:
        max_connections: 1000
        max_users: 250

    # Logging configuration. Possible output values to disk via
    # '/var/lib/teleport/teleport.log',
    # 'stdout', 'stderr' and 'syslog'. Possible severity values are DEBUG, INFO (default), WARN,
    # and ERROR.
    log:
        output: /var/lib/teleport/teleport.log
        severity: INFO

        # Log format configuration
        # Possible output values are 'json' and 'text' (default).
        # Possible extra_fields values include: timestamp, component, caller,
        # and level.
        # All extra fields are included by default.
        format:
          output: text
          extra_fields: [level, timestamp, component, caller]

```

### Proxy Service

These settings apply to the Teleport Proxy Service:

<Tip>
  Teleport Enterprise Cloud manages the Proxy Service for you, so you do not need
  to specify these configuration settings.
</Tip>

```yaml
# This section configures the 'proxy service'
proxy_service:
    # Turns 'proxy' role on. Default is 'yes'
    enabled: yes

    # ProxyProtocol enables support for HAProxy proxy protocol version 1 when
    # it is turned 'on'.

    # The default value is 'on'.
    proxy_protocol: on

    # SSH forwarding/proxy address. Command line (CLI) clients always begin
    # their SSH sessions by connecting to this port
    #
    # If not set, behavior depends on the config file version:
    #
    # v2 and above: listener is not created, SSH is multiplexed on web_listen_addr
    # v1: defaults to 0.0.0.0:3023
    listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3023

    # Reverse tunnel listening address. An auth server (CA) can establish an
    # outbound (from behind the firewall) connection to this address.
    # This will allow users of the outside CA to connect to
    # behind-the-firewall nodes.
    #
    # If not set, behavior depends on the config file version:

    # balancer.
    # Use a TCP load balancer because this port uses SSH protocol.
    ssh_public_addr: proxy.example.com:3023

    # The DNS name of the tunnel SSH endpoint as accessible by trusted clusters
    # and nodes joining the cluster via Teleport IoT/node tunneling.
    # Defaults to the proxy's hostname if not specified. If running multiple

    # Interval between attempts to reload the certificate key pairs.
    # If one of the key pairs fails to load, then no key pair is reloaded.
    # If set to 0 (the default), then periodic reloading is disabled.
    # To use this feature correctly, certificate files should be updated atomically.
    https_keypairs_reload_interval: 1h

    # Kubernetes proxy listen address.
    #
    # If not set, behavior depends on the config file version:
    #
    # v2 and above: listener is not created, Kubernetes traffic is multiplexed on web_listen_addr
    # v1: defaults to 0.0.0.0:3026
    kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3026
    # optional: set a different public address for kubernetes access
    kube_public_addr: kube.example.com:3026

    # MySQL proxy listen address.

    ui:
      # The amount of scrollback in the terminal. Scrollback is the amount of
      # rows that are retained when lines are scrolled beyond the initial
      # viewport. Does not apply to session recording view.
      scrollback_lines: 1000

    # Enables the Proxy service to take client source IPs from the
    # "X-Forwarded-For" headers for web APIs.
    #
    # In order to prevent IP spoofing, it is important to ensure that the Proxy
    # service is placed behind a layer 7 load balancer or reverse proxy that
    # sets client IPs in the "X-Forwarded-For" headers. Requests with more than
    # one IPs will be rejected.
    trust_x_forwarded_for: false

## Configuration versions

In order to avoid breaking existing configurations, Teleport's configuration is
versioned. The newer configuration version is `v3`. If a `version` is not
specified in the configuration file, `v1` is assumed.

Some new Teleport features require users to opt-in by explicitly upgrading their
configuration to a newer version.

### Config `v1`

`v1` is the original version of Teleport's file configuration. It is still supported
today, but most new users should start with the latest configuration version.

### Config `v2`

Configuration version `v2` was introduced in Teleport 8 as part of Teleport's
TLS routing feature. With TLS routing, Teleport's proxy listens on a single port
and uses ALPN and SNI to route incoming traffic to the correct Teleport service
rather than listening on multiple protocol-specific ports.

For backwards compatibility, configuration version `v1` always listens on these
protocol-specific ports. When Teleport is using configuration version `v2`, the
individual protocol-specific ports are not opened unless explicitly set.

### Config `v3`

Configuration version `v3` was introduced with Teleport 11. In version 3, the
`auth_servers` field is no longer supported, and agents must specify one of
`auth_server` or `proxy_server` to indicate which endpoint to use for joining a
Teleport cluster.

Previous versions of Teleport allowed for `auth_servers` to point to Auth
Servers or Proxy Servers. As a result, Teleport would try to connect in multiple
different modes, resulting in confusing error messages. With config version 3,
Teleport only attempts to connect in a single mode, which is both more efficient
and easier to troubleshoot.

For example, this excerpt from a `v2` config can be converted to `v3` with the
following changes.

```diff
-version: v2
+version: v3
teleport:
-  auth_servers: [ teleport.example.com:443 ]
+  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
```
