<Accordion title="Version warning">
  Machine ID for GitHub Actions is available starting from Teleport `v11.0`.
</Accordion>

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that works as a part of the larger
GitHub ecosystem.

In this guide, you will use Machine ID and the Teleport Kubernetes Service to
allow a GitHub Actions workflow to securely connect to a Kubernetes cluster
without the need for long-lived secrets.

Teleport supports secure joining on both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted GitHub
Actions runners as well as GitHub Enterprise Server.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open Source">
    - A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our
      [Getting Started](/docs/ver/13.x/index) guide.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```

      See [Installation](/docs/ver/13.x/installation) for details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0,
      which you can download by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.
- A Kubernetes cluster connected to your Teleport cluster. If you do not already
  have one configured, try our
  [Kubernetes Access getting started guide.](/docs/ver/13.x/kubernetes-access/getting-started)
  In our examples, this Kubernetes cluster will be named `my-kubernetes-cluster`.
- Your Teleport user should have the privileges to create token resources.
- A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled. This guide uses the example
  `gravitational/example`, and this value should be replaced with your own unique
  repository.

<Note>
  For self-hosted Teleport Clusters that have non-TLS routing the Kubernetes public
  address must be set for Machine ID Kubernetes connections.

  To confirm the TLS routing mode check the `proxy.tls_routing_enabled` from this
  command with your proxy address:

  ```code
  $ curl https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/ping | jq
  ```

  The optional tool [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is used here to help display the JSON output.
  If the value `proxy.tls_routing_enabled` is `false` then non-TLS routing
  is set and a Kubernetes public address is required so Machine ID
  will connect to the right port. You can confirm the Kubernetes public
  address is set if `proxy.kube.public_addr` is populated.

  The `kube_public_addr` is set within the `proxy_service` by Teleport administrators:

  ```yaml
  proxy_service:
    enabled: true
    kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3026
    kube_public_addr: teleport.example.com:3026
  ```
</Note>

## Step 1/4. Create a join token for GitHub Actions

In order to allow your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with your
Teleport cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out
criteria by which the Auth Server decides whether or not to allow a bot or node
to join.

To create a token, we can write the resource's YAML to a file on disk, and then
use `tctl` to apply it.

Create a file named `tokenconfig.yaml` and insert the following contents:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub">
    ```yaml
    kind: token
    version: v2
    metadata:
      name: github-token
    spec:
      roles: [Bot]
      join_method: github
      bot_name: github-demo
      github:
        allow:
          - repository: gravitational/example
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub Enterprise Server">
    From Teleport 11.1.4, users with Teleport Enterprise are able to permit
    workflows within GitHub Enterprise Server instances to authenticate using the
    GitHub join method.

    This is configured by an additional `enterprise_server_host` field in the Token
    resource. This should be set to the host of your GHES instance.

    ```yaml
    kind: token
    version: v2
    metadata:
      name: github-token
    spec:
      roles: [Bot]
      join_method: github
      bot_name: github-demo
      github:
        enterprise_server_host: your.ghes.instance.example.com
        allow:
          - repository: gravitational/example
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's go over the token resource YAML's fields in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need
  to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This
  example is set to the year `2100`.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant
  access to. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the
  configuration later.
- `spec.roles` defines which roles that this token will grant access to. The
  value of `[Bot]` states that this token grants access to a Machine ID bot.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since
  this guide only focuses on GitHub Actions, we will set this to to `github`.
- `spec.github.allow` is used to set rules for what GitHub Actions will be able
  to authenticate by using the token. In this example, the `gravitational/example`
  repository is used, and this example repository should be replaced with your own
  repo.

You can find a full list of the token configuration options for GitHub Actions
joining on the
[GitHub Actions reference page.](/docs/ver/13.x/machine-id/reference/github-actions#github-join-token)

Once the resource file has been written, create the token with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f tokenconfig.yaml
```

Check that token `github-token` has been created with the following
command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token       Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
----------- ---- ------ ----------------------------------------------
github-token Bot         01 Jan 00 00:00 UTC (2562047h47m16.854775807s)
```

## Step 2/4. Create a Machine ID bot

With the join token for the GitHub Actions workflow created, you now need to
create a Machine ID bot that the token will grant access to. A Machine ID bot is
a special type of Teleport user designed for access by machines, and can
authenticate using a join token rather than forms of authentication more
suitable to users (e.g. SSO.)

Before creating the bot, first you must create a role in Teleport which grants
the bot access to your Kubernetes clusters and defines the Kubernetes RBAC
groups that will be added to your bot's requests to the Kubernetes cluster.

Create `role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: github-demo-kube-access
version: v5
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      # This grants access to any Kubernetes cluster attached to your Teleport
      # cluster.
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_groups:
      # This group will be attached to requests made by users with this role
      # to the Kubernetes API. Configure a cluster role binding that binds this 
      # group to a Kubernetes cluster role to grant privileges to this Teleport 
      # role in the Kubernetes cluster.
      - github-demo
  deny: {}
```

Note the value provided in `kubernetes_groups`. In a later step, you will bind
this group to a Kubernetes role with a cluster role binding.

Apply this to your Teleport cluster:

```code
$ tctl create -f role.yaml
```

Now create the Machine ID bot, assigning it the role you created above:

```code
$ tctl bots add github-demo --roles=github-demo-kube-access --token=github-token
```

## Step 3/4. Configure a Kubernetes cluster role binding

With the bot configured and a Teleport role that will pass a group to
Kubernetes with the bot's requests, you now need a role binding to associate a
Kubernetes role to that group.

This is the stage where you determine what level of access the bot will have
when accessing your cluster. In our example, we are applying the `view` cluster
role which will allow our bot to read, but not write, all resources in the
Kubernetes cluster.

In your case you may want a custom Kubernetes role that lists the exact
permissions your bot needs. You can also use a role binding rather than a
cluster role binding to limit the bot's access to an individual Kubernetes
namespace.

Create a file named `clusterolebinding.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: github-demo-group
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    # Name field should match the group configured in the 
    # `allow.kubernetes_groups` of a role belonging to the user you wish to
    # grant access to.
    name: github-demo
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  # "view" is a default ClusterRole that grants read-only access to resources
  # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles
  name: view
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Create this cluster role binding in your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`:

```
$ kubectl apply -f ./clusterolebinding.yaml
```

## Step 4/4. Create the GitHub Actions workflow

With all the configuration in Teleport and Kubernetes complete, you can now
create a GitHub Actions workflow that can connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

Our example workflow will list all of the pods contained within the cluster,
but this could just as easily be modified to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster with
`kubectl` or `helm`.

In the GitHub workflows directory of your repository (`.github/workflows/`)
create a new workflow YAML file `actionstest.yml`.

Insert the following, replacing `my-kubernetes-cluster` with the name of your
Kubernetes cluster and `example.domain:443` with the address of your Teleport
Proxy or cloud tenant (e.g. `example.teleport.sh`).

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started, modify it for your needs.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or Machine ID will not be 
      # able to authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    name: guide-demo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Fetch kubectl
        uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
      - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
        uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
        with:
          version: 13.2.0
      - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
        uses: teleport-actions/auth-k8s@v1
        with:
          # Use the address of the auth/proxy server for your own cluster.
          proxy: example.domain:443
          # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
          token: github-token
          # Use the name of your Kubernetes cluster
          kubernetes-cluster: my-kubernetes-cluster
          # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry.
          anonymous-telemetry: 1
      - name: List pods
        run: kubectl get pods -A
```

`anonymous-telemetry` enables the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This
helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
omitting this.

The `auth-k8s` action sets the `KUBECONFIG` for future steps to the credentials
it has fetched from Teleport. This means that most existing tooling for
Kubernetes (e.g `kubectl` and `helm`) can use your cluster with no additional
configuration.

Add, commit, and push this new workflow file to the default branch of your
repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `guide-demo` job.

Expand the **List pods** step of the action, where you can then confirm that the
output shows a list of all the pods within your Kubernetes cluster.

## A note on security implications and risk

Once `teleport-actions/auth-k8s` has been used in a workflow job, all successive
steps in that job will have access to your Kubernetes cluster as your bot. Where
possible, run as few steps as necessary after this action has been used. It may
be a good idea to break your workflow up into multiple jobs in order to
segregate these credentials from other code running in your CI/CD pipeline.

Most importantly, ensure that the role assigned to your GitHub Actions bot has
access to only the resources in your Teleport cluster that your CI/CD needs to
interact with.
