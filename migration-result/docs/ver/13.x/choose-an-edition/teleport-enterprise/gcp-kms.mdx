h1: Store Teleport Private Keys in Google Cloud KMS
version: "13.x"
---

This guide will show you how to set up your Teleport Cluster to use the Google
Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to store and handle the CA private key
material used to sign all certificates issued by your Teleport cluster.

<Accordion title="Version warning">
  The features documented on this page are available in Teleport `11.1.0` and higher.
</Accordion>

Teleport generates private key material for its internal Certificate Authorities
(CAs) during the first Auth Server's initial startup.
These CAs are used to sign all certificates issued to clients and hosts in the
Teleport cluster.
When configured to use Google Cloud KMS, all private key material for these CAs
will be generated, stored, and used for signing inside of Google Cloud KMS.
Instead of the actual private key, Teleport will only store the ID of the KMS
key.
In short, private key material will never leave Google Cloud KMS.

If launching a new Teleport cluster this will all be handled during initial
startup with no specific interventions required after configuration.
For existing Teleport clusters that already have private key material on disk,
a CA rotation must be performed. This ensures that the private key material
only ever exists in KMS when this feature is enabled.

  </Tabs>

- A Google Cloud account.

## Step 1/5. Create a key ring in GCP

Each Teleport Auth Server will need to be configured to use a GCP key ring
which will hold all keys generated and used by that Auth Server.
If running a High-Availability Teleport cluster with two or more Auth Servers,
every Auth Server can be configured to use the same key ring, or if desired each
can be configured to use a unique key ring in a different region (for redundancy
or to decrease latency).

It is recommended to create a dedicated key ring for use by Teleport to logically
separate it from any other keys in your cloud account.
Choose a supported
[KMS location](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations)
for the key ring which is geographically near to your Teleport Auth Servers.

You can create a key ring from the Google Cloud Console or from the `gcloud` CLI
tool. Follow
[this guide](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-asymmetric-keys#create_a_key_ring)
or run the following command if you have the `gcloud` CLI configured:

```bash
$ gcloud kms keyrings create "teleport-keyring" --location location
```

## Step 2/5. Create a GCP service account

Teleport needs permissions to create, list, destroy, sign with, and view KMS
keys in your key ring. Start by creating the following custom IAM role.

```yaml
# teleport_kms_role.yaml
title: teleport_kms_role
description: 'Teleport permissions for using KMS keys'
stage: ALPHA
includedPermissions:
- cloudkms.cryptoKeys.create
- cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.create
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.destroy
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToSign
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.viewPublicKey
```

```bash
$ gcloud iam roles create teleport_kms_role \
    --project GCP-Project-ID \
    --file teleport_kms_role.yaml \
    --format yaml
```

Note the `name` field in the output which is the fully qualified name for the
custom role and must be used in later steps.

```bash
$ export IAM_ROLE=<role name output from above>
```

If you don't already have a GCP service account for your Teleport Auth Server
you can create one with the following command, otherwise use your existing
service account.

```bash
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create teleport-auth-server \
    --description="Service account for Teleport Auth Server" \
    --display-name="Teleport Auth Server" \
    --format=yaml
```

Note the `email` field in the output, this must be used as the identifier for
the service account.

```bash
$ export SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<email output from above command>
```

Create the IAM policy binding to grant the role to the service account for this
keyring.

```bash
$ gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding teleport-keyring \
    --location location \
    --member "serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
    --role "${IAM_ROLE}"
```

## Step 3/5. Provide the service account credentials to your Auth Server

The Teleport Auth Server will use Application Default Credentials to make
requests to the GCP KMS service.
Provide credentials for the `teleport-auth-server` service account created in
step 2 to the Application Default Credentials of the environment you are running
your Teleport Auth Server in.
Supported environments include GCE VMs, GKE pods, and others.

See the GCP docs for
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc)
to learn how to provide them for your preferred environment.

<Accordion title="Manually checking permissions">
  To make sure the credentials have been configured correctly, you can run the
  `gcloud` CLI tool from your Teleport Auth Server's environment. Some example
  commands you could use to debug are listed here:

  ```bash
  $ gcloud kms keys list --location location --keyring "teleport-keyring"
  Listed 0 items.
  $ gcloud kms keys create --location location --keyring "teleport-keyring" \
      --purpose asymmetric-signing \
      --default-algorithm rsa-sign-pkcs1-4096-sha512 \
      test-key
  $ gcloud kms keys list --location location --keyring "teleport-keyring"
  NAME                                                                                   PURPOSE          ALGORITHM                   PROTECTION_LEVEL
  projects/my-gcp-account/locations/global/keyRings/teleport-keyring/cryptoKeys/test-key ASYMMETRIC_SIGN  RSA_SIGN_PKCS1_4096_SHA512  SOFTWARE
  $ echo hello > /tmp/hello.txt
  $ gcloud kms asymmetric-sign --keyring "teleport-keyring" --location location \
      --key "test-key" --version 1 \
      --input-file /tmp/hello.txt --signature-file /tmp/hello.sig
  $ gcloud kms keys versions destroy --keyring "teleport-keyring" --location location --key "test-key" 1
  ```
</Accordion>

## Step 4/5. Configure your Auth Server to use KMS keys

CA key parameters are statically configured in the `teleport.yaml` configuration
file of the Teleport Auth Server(s) in your cluster.

Find the fully qualified name of the KMS key ring you created in
[step 1](#step-15-create-a-key-ring-in-gcp)
in the GCP Console or by running:

```bash
$ gcloud kms keyrings list --location location
```

<Accordion title="Choosing a protection level">
  Supported KMS protection levels are `SOFTWARE` and `HSM`.
  If you choose `SOFTWARE`, GCP KMS will performs all cryptographic operations in
  software (Teleport performs no cryptographic operations).
  If you choose `HSM`, GCP KMS will perform all cryptographic operations in a
  Hardware Security Module.

  Both protection levels are considered secure by Google and Teleport, you should
  evaluate your own organization's requirements and security policies when making
  your decision.

  One relevant difference is the usage quotas available to keys of each protection
  level.
  At the time of writing, software keys have a project-wide quota of 60k
  cryptographic operations per minute, while asymmetric HSM keys have a quota of
  3k operations per minute.
  See the [KMS docs](https://cloud.google.com/kms/quotas) for updated numbers.
  If your cluster will have many thousands of hosts or active users, the higher
  quota software keys have may help to avoid any potential throttling, especially
  during CA rotations where many new certificates must be signed.
</Accordion>

Include the following `ca_key_params` configuration in the `auth_service` section.

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
auth_service:
  # ...
  ca_key_params:
    gcp_kms:
      keyring: "projects/<your-gcp-project>/locations/<location>/keyRing/<your-teleport-keyring>"
      protection_level: "SOFTWARE"
```

If configuring this before the first start of a new Teleport cluster, the
initial CA keys will be generated in GCP and no additional steps are necessary.
If you wish to migrate an existing Teleport cluster from software keys to GCP
KMS keys, read on to
[migrating an existing cluster](#migrating-an-existing-cluster).

## Step 5/5. Make sure everything is working

After starting up your Auth Server with the `gcp_kms` configuration, you can
confirm that Teleport has generated keys in your keyring in the GCP Console or
by running

```bash
$ gcloud kms keys list --keyring "teleport-keyring" --location location
```

Try logging in to the cluster with a Teleport user to make sure that new
certificates can be signed without error.

## Migrating an existing cluster

If you have an existing Teleport cluster it will have already created CA keys
during its first start.
Those existing CA keys will have been used to sign all existing user and host
certificates, and will be trusted by all other services in your cluster.

When an Auth Server starts up with a `gcp_kms` keyring configured in its
`ca_key_params`, it will refuse to sign any certificates with any existing
software keys in the CA.
This will prevent any new user logins or new hosts from joining your cluster if
their requests are directed to that Auth Server and effectively cause downtime
for that server until a CA rotation is completed.

If some downtime until you can complete a CA rotation is acceptable, the
migration can be performed in three steps:

1. Configure all Auth Servers `ca_key_params` to use your desired KMS keyring,
   as described in [Step 4](#step-45-configure-your-auth-server-to-use-kms-keys).
2. Restart all Auth Servers.
3. Perform a full [CA rotation](/docs/ver/13.x/management/operations/ca-rotation).

To avoid any downtime while migrating your cluster, do the following procedure
instead:

1. Start a new Auth Server with an identical backend configuration to your
   existing Auth Servers and with `ca_key_params` configured to use your KMS key
   ring. Make sure no requests are routed to this new, temporary, Auth Server by
   not adding it to your load balancer. You can run this anywhere with access to
   your existing backend and new KMS key ring, one option would be to run it
   locally on an existing Auth Server host (make sure to give it its own
   `teleport.yaml` and unique `data_dir`).
2. Perform a full [CA rotation](/docs/ver/13.x/management/operations/ca-rotation).
   The temporary Auth Server will generate new KMS keys and include their names in
   the backend CA state.
3. Stop/remove/delete the temporary Auth Server as it is no longer necessary.
4. Configure all other existing Auth Servers with identical `ca_key_params` and
   reload/restart them, one by one. They will now use the KMS keys generated by the
   temporary Auth Server.
5. Perform one more full CA rotation to evict all now-unused software keys from the
   CA backend state so that hosts will no longer trust them.
