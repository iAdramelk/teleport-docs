title: "How to Choose a Teleport Edition"
description: "Read this guide to determine whether to deploy Teleport Enterprise, Teleport Cloud, or Open Source Teleport"
version: '13.x'
---

Teleport supports four editions. In this guide, we will help you determine
which edition is most appropriate for your use case.

## Editions

### Teleport Team

Teleport Team makes it easier for small organizations to get started enabling
secure access to their infrastructure. It includes a subset of Teleport
Enterprise Cloud features, and teams can switch to Teleport Enterprise Cloud as
they scale up.

[Read more about Teleport Team](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-team).

### Teleport Enterprise Cloud

Our team at Teleport manages the Auth and Proxy Services, giving you a running
Teleport cluster where you can configure RBAC, set up Single Sign-On connectors,
and register resources by deploying additional Teleport services.

[Read more about Teleport Enterprise Cloud](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/introduction).

### Teleport Enterprise

A self-hosted Teleport deployment for security-conscious organizations.
Supports advanced features like Hardware Security Modules and FedRAMP
compliance.

[Read more about Teleport Enterprise](/docs/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction).

### Teleport Community Edition

We provide a free, open source distribution of Teleport that enables you to get
secure access to databases, Windows desktops, Kubernetes clusters, and more.

[Try out Teleport on a Linux server](/docs/ver/13.x/index). If you would like to
take a look at the source, visit the [Teleport GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport).
