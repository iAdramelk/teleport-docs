### 15.1.0

#### Standalone `tbot` Docker image

We will ship a new container image that contains `tbot` but omits other
Teleport binaries, providing a light-weight option for Machine ID users.

#### Custom mouse pointers for remote desktop sessions

Teleport remote desktop sessions will automatically change the mouse cursor
depending on context (when hovering over a link, resizing a window, or editing
text, for example).

#### New paginated APIs

Teleport's gRPC server will expose new paginated APIs for listing roles and
access requests, which will improve performance on clusters with large numbers
of these resources.

#### Synchronization of Okta groups and apps

Okta integration will support automatic synchronization of Okta groups and app
assignments to Teleport as access lists giving users ability to request access
to Okta apps without extra configuration.

#### EKS auto-discovery in Access Management UI

Users going through EKS enrollment flow in Access Management web UI will have
an option to enable auto-discovery for EKS clusters.

### 15.1.1

#### SSH remote port forwarding

In Teleport 15.1, we will expose remote port forwarding via the `tsh ssh -R`
command. Remote port forwarding will be supported for both Teleport and OpenSSH
nodes.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `15.0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `15.X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as 15.1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.

## Preview Policy
