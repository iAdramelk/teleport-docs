In this guide, you will configure Machine ID's agent, `tbot`, to run within a
CircleCI workflow. The bot will be configured to use the `circleci` delegated
joining method to eliminate the need for long-lived secrets.

    Proxy version: 14.3.6
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/docs/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >=
      15.0.2.

      account workspace](https://teleport.sh).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v15.0.2 git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v15.0.2 go1.21
    Proxy version: 15.0.2
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you don't have an account,
      sign up to begin a [free trial](https://goteleport.com/signup/)  of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 14.3.6.

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v14.3.6 git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v14.3.6 go1.21
    Proxy version: 14.3.6
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  15.0.2
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.
- A CircleCI project connected to a Git repository you can push to.

## Step 1/5. Configure CircleCI

In order to configure the rules for which CircleCI workflows will be allowed to
connect to your Teleport cluster, you must determine the ID of your CircleCI
organization and create a CircleCI context.

### Find your organization ID

Open CircleCI and navigate to "Organization settings" from the navbar.
You should be presented with an interface titled "Overview" with a section
called "Organization ID". Note this value down and substitute `$ORGANIZATION_ID`
in configuration examples with this.

### Create a context

CircleCI has an organization-level concept called
**contexts**, which allow you to configure a series of secrets that should be
exposed to a workflow job. You can configure CircleCI to control which actors
are allowed to trigger jobs associated with a context.

The contexts that a workflow job has been assigned are also encoded in the
identity token that CircleCI creates for the job. This makes them an ideal way
for Teleport to determine which CircleCI jobs should be granted access to the
Teleport cluster.

In this example, you will create a CircleCI context named `teleport-access`.
You will then grant this context access to your Teleport cluster.

To create the CircleCI context, open up "Organization settings" in CircleCI
and navigate to "Contexts". Click "Create Context" and provide `teleport-access`
as the name of the context you wish to create. You may substitute this value
for a string that makes more sense to your organization, but ensure in future
steps of this guide that you replace `teleport-access` with your value.

Select the context you have just created. You will now be on a page that allows
you to configure the context. To determine the ID of the context
to use when configuring Teleport, locate the URL of the
context settings page, which should have a format similar to the following:

```text
https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/github/gravitational/contexts/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

In this case, the context ID is: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

Note this value down and substitute `$CONTEXT_ID` in configuration examples
with this.

## Step 2/5. Create the join token for CircleCI

In order to allow your CircleCI workflow to authenticate with your Teleport
cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out criteria
by which the Auth Server decides whether or not to allow a bot or node to join.

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`, ensuring that you replace
`$ORGANIZATION_ID` and `$CONTEXT_ID` with the values from Step 1.

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: circleci
  bot_name: example
  circleci:
    organization_id: $ORGANIZATION_ID
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Server determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - context_id: $CONTEXT_ID
```

Let's go over the token resource's fields in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need
  to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This
  example is set to the year `2100`.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant
  access to. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the
  configuration later.
- `spec.roles` defines which roles that this token will grant access to. The
  value of `[Bot]` states that this token grants access to a Machine ID bot.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since
  this guide only focuses on CircleCI, you will set this to to `circleci`.
- `spec.circleci.allow` is used to set rules for what CircleCI runs will be able
  to authenticate by using the token.

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 3/5. Create a role and Machine ID bot

Now, a role must be created that will be encoded into the credentials output by
`tbot`. This role will specify what the credentials will grant access to.
For now, this role will be "empty" - the access guides you complete after this
platform guide will instruct you to modify this role to grant the correct
privileges.

Create `bot-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  allow: {}
  deny: {}
  options: {}
```

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-role.yaml
```

Create the bot, specifying the role and token that you have created:

```code
$ tctl bots add example --roles=example-bot --token=example-bot
```

## Step 4/5. Configure a CircleCI workflow

With the bot and join token created, you can now configure a CircleCI
workflow that can connect to your Teleport cluster.

To configure `tbot`, a YAML file will be used. In this example we'll store this
within the repository itself, but this could be generated or created by the
CI pipeline itself.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
auth_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: circleci
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step

Now, the CircleCI pipeline can be defined. Before the pipeline can use `tbot`,
it must be available within the environment. For this example, we'll show
downloading `tbot` as part of the CI step, but in a production implementation
you may wish to build a docker image that contains this binary to avoid
depending on the Teleport CDN.

Open your Git repository and create a directory called `.circleci`. Then open
a file called `config.yml` and insert the following configuration:

```yaml
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
version: 2.1
jobs:
  write-run-log:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Install Teleport"
          command: |
            cd /tmp
            curl -O https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-v15.0.2-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            tar -xvf teleport-v15.0.2-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            sudo ./teleport/install
      - run:
          name: "Run Machine ID"
          command: |
            export TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1
            tbot start -c tbot.yaml
workflows:
  write-run-log:
    jobs:
      - write-run-log:
          context:
            - teleport-access
```

`TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` enables the submission of anonymous usage
telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable
this by omitting this.

Add, commit, and push these two configuration files to your repository.

Open CircleCI and check the status of the job, wait for it to complete and
ensure that no errors are emitted.

### A note on security implications and risk

Once `tbot start` has been used in a job, all successive steps in that job will
have access to the credentials that have been produced by `tbot`. Break your
workflow down into multiple jobs to reduce the amount of steps that have access
to these credentials.

Ensure that the role you assign to your CircleCI bot has access to only the
resources in your Teleport cluster that your CI/CD needs to interact with.

## Step 5/5. Configure outputs

You have now prepared the base configuration for `tbot`. At this point, it
identifies itself to the Teleport cluster and renews its own credentials but
does not output any credentials for other applications to use.

Follow one of the [access guides](/docs/machine-id/access-guides) to configure an output
that meets your access needs.
