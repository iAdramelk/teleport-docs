Teleport gives you fine-grained control over who can access resources in your
infrastructure as well as how they can access those resources. Once you have
deployed a Teleport cluster, configure access controls to achieve the right
security policies for your organization.

- [Dual Authorization](/docs/access-controls/guides/dual-authz): Protect access to critical resources with dual authorization.
- [Role Templates](/docs/access-controls/guides/role-templates): Set up Dynamic Access Policies with Role Templates.
- [Impersonating Teleport Users](/docs/access-controls/guides/impersonation): Create certificates for CI/CD with impersonation.
- [Passwordless](/docs/access-controls/guides/passwordless): Use passwordless authentication.
- [Multi-Factor: WebAuthn](/docs/access-controls/guides/webauthn): Add multi-factor authentication through WebAuthn.
- [Per-Session MFA](/docs/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa): Per-session multi-mactor authentication.
- [MFA for Administrative Actions](/docs/access-controls/guides/mfa-for-admin-actions): Multi-mactor authentication for admin actions.
- [Locking](/docs/access-controls/guides/locking): Lock access to active user sessions or hosts.
- [Moderated Sessions](/docs/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions): Require session auditors and allow fine-grained live session access.
- [Hardware Key Support](/docs/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support): Enforce the use of hardware-based private keys.
- [Device Trust](/docs/access-controls/device-trust/guide): Register and enforce trusted devices.
- [Headless WebAuthn](/docs/access-controls/guides/headless): Login with Webauthn from a remote device.
