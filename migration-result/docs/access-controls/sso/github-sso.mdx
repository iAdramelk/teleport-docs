This guide explains how to set up GitHub Single Sign On (SSO) so you can
automatically map teams in your GitHub organization to users and roles in
Teleport.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub organization with at least one team.

  In Teleport Community Edition and Teleport Team, this organization must not
  have external SSO set up, or Teleport will refuse to create the GitHub
  authentication connector.

  In Teleport Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud, organization can be hosted from
  either GitHub Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server.

- Teleport role with access to maintaining `github` resources for using `tctl`
  from the Desktop. This is available in the default `editor` role.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Teleport Community Edition">
    - A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the
      [Getting Started](/docs/index) guide.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 15.0.0-dev.

      See [Installation](/docs/installation) for details.

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport v15.0.0-dev git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v15.0.0-dev go1.21
    Proxy version: 15.0.0-dev
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Team">
    - A Teleport Team account. If you don't have an account, sign
      up to begin your [free trial](https://goteleport.com/signup/).

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool, version >= 13.4.3.

      You can download these tools from the [Cloud Downloads page](/docs/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v13.4.3 git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v13.4.3 go1.21
    Proxy version: 13.4.3
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/docs/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >=
      15.0.0-dev.

      You can download these tools by visiting your [Teleport
      account workspace](https://teleport.sh).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v15.0.0-dev git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v15.0.0-dev go1.21
    Proxy version: 15.0.0-dev
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you don't have an account,
      sign up to begin a [free trial](https://goteleport.com/signup/)  of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.4.3.

      You can download these tools from the [Cloud Downloads page](/docs/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v13.4.3 git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v13.4.3 go1.21
    Proxy version: 13.4.3
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  15.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.

## Step 1/3. Create a GitHub OAuth app

Create and register a GitHub OAuth App. When you do so, ensure that your OAuth
App's "Authentication callback URL" is the following:

```
https://PROXY_ADDRESS/v1/webapi/github/
```

Replace `PROXY_ADDRESS` with be the public address of the Teleport Proxy Service
or your Teleport Cloud workspace URL (e.g., `example.teleport.sh`).

The app must have the `read:org` scope in order to be able to read org and team
membership details.

Instructions for creating a GitHub OAuth app are available in [GitHub's
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

Create a client secret to use along with the client ID in the next step:

![A GitHub Oauth App, highlighting Client ID and secret](../../../../assets/github-app-vars-ece6d35f8e.png)

## Step 2/3. Create a GitHub authentication connector

In this section, you will define a GitHub authentication connector using `tctl`.

On your workstation, create a file called `client-secret.txt` consisting only of
your client secret.

Update this example command with:

- Your OAuth app's client ID and client secret created during the previous step.
- The roles you want to map from your GitHub organization to Teleport roles.
  Roles are defined in the **Repository roles** section of your organization's
  settings.

See [tctl sso configure github](/docs/reference/cli/tctl#tctl-sso-configure-github)
for a full reference of flags for this command:

```code
$ tctl sso configure github \
--id=GITHUB-CLIENT-ID \
--secret=$(cat client-secret.txt) \
--teams-to-roles=ORG-NAME,github-team,access,editor \
> github.yaml
```

<Tip>
  GitHub organizations and teams should be referred to by their slug, not display name.
  To create the slug, GitHub replaces special characters in the name string, changes all words to lowercase,
  and replaces spaces with a `-` separator. For example, `My TEam NÃ¤me` would become `my-team-name`.
  You can confirm the slug in GitHub Web application URLs or via the GitHub API.
  Example: navigate to the team `My Team` in the GitHub web application.
  The URL `https://github.com/orgs/org-name/teams/my-team`
  shows the slug is `my-team`.
</Tip>

The contents of `github.yaml` should resemble the following:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Teleport Community Edition">
    ```yaml
    kind: github
    metadata:
      name: github
    spec:
      api_endpoint_url: ""

      redirect_url: https://<proxy-address>/v1/webapi/github/callback
      teams_to_logins: null
      teams_to_roles:
        - organization: ORG-NAME
          roles:
            - access
            - editor
          team: github-team
    version: v3
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Commercial">
    ```yaml
    kind: github
    metadata:
      name: github
    spec:
      api_endpoint_url: https://api.github.com

      redirect_url: https://<proxy-address>/v1/webapi/github/callback
      teams_to_logins: null
      teams_to_roles:
        - organization: org-name
          roles:
            - access
            - editor
            - reviewer
          team: github-team
    version: v3
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Mapping multiple roles">
  You can add multiple instances of the `--teams-to-roles` flag or edit the connector
  file to define multiple mappings. For example:

  ```code
  $  tctl sso configure github \
  --id=GITHUB-CLIENT-ID \
  --secret=$(cat client-secret.txt) \
  --teams-to-roles=ORG-NAME,github-team,access,editor \
  --teams-to-roles="org-name,administrators,admins \
  --teams-to-roles="different-org,developers,dev \
  > github.yaml
  ```

  ```yaml
  spec.
    teams_to_roles:
      - organization: org-name
        roles:
          - access
          - editor
        team: github-team
      - organization: org-name
        roles:
          - admins
        team: administrators
      - organization: different-org
        roles:
          - devs
        team: developers
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Self-hosting GitHub Enterprise?">
  For self-hosted GitHub Enterprise servers, you can specify the server
  instance endpoints with the `--endpoint-url`, `--api-endpoint-url` parameters:

  ```code
  $ tctl sso configure github \
  --id=GITHUB-CLIENT-ID \
  --secret=$(cat client-secret.txt) \
  --teams-to-roles=ORG-NAME,github-team,access,editor \
  --endpoint-url=https://github-enterprise-server-address
  --api-endpoint-url=https://api-github-enterprise-server-address
  > github.yaml
  ```

  ```yaml
  ...
  spec:
    ...
    api_endpoint_url: https://<api-github-enterprise-server-address>
    endpoint_url: https://<github-enterprise-server-address>
    ...
  ```
</Accordion>

You can test the connector configuration before applying it to your cluster.
This is strongly encouraged to avoid interruption to active clusters:

```code
$ cat github.yaml | tctl sso test
If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
 http://127.0.0.1:52690/35714f6b-...
Success! Logged in as: alice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authentication details:
   roles:
   - access
   - editor
   traits:
     github_teams:
     - admins
     kubernetes_groups: null
     kubernetes_users: null
     logins:
     - alice
   username: alice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GitHub] Received claims:
organization_to_teams:
  Octocats:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GitHub] Connector team to roles mapping:
- organization: Octocats
  roles:
  - access
  - editor
  team: admins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For more details repeat the command with --debug flag.
```

Finally, create the connector using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f github.yaml
authentication connector "github" has been created
```

<Tip>
  When going through the GitHub authentication flow for the first time,
  the application must be granted access to all organizations that are
  present in the "teams to logins" mapping, otherwise Teleport will not be
  able to determine team memberships for these organizations.
</Tip>

After a user authenticates, Teleport will add the user's GitHub username to their
`internal.logins` trait for their Teleport session. The preset `access` role has this
trait variable configured to include the GitHub user as an authorized SSH login.
Here is an example role configuration snippet using the trait variable:

```yaml
  allow:
    # List of allowed SSH logins
    logins: ['{{internal.logins}}', ubuntu, debian]

    # List of node labels that users can SSH into
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

## Step 3/4. Log in to Teleport using GitHub

You can now log in with Teleport using GitHub SSO. Run the following to log out
of Teleport and log in again using GitHub SSO.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    ```code
    $ tsh logout
    # Logged out all users from all proxies.
    $ tsh login --proxy=tele.example.com --auth=github
    If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
     http://127.0.0.1:56334/6bf976e6-a4be-4898-94eb-8a7b01af2158
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    ```code
    $ tsh logout
    # Logged out all users from all proxies.
    $ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --auth=github
    If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
     http://127.0.0.1:56334/6bf976e6-a4be-4898-94eb-8a7b01af2158
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also log to the web UI using GitHub by clicking **Other sign-in options** at the login screen.

When you sign in for the first time, you will see a prompt to authorize your
GitHub OAuth app:

![GitHub SSO authorization view](../../../../assets/github-sso-auth-screen-1904963b72.jpg)

Teleport will request only the `read:org` OAuth scope. Read more about OAuth scopes in GitHub's documentation:
[GitHub OAuth scopes](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/)

After logging in successfully, you will see the following:

![Login success view](../../../../assets/login-success-34ebe095d0.png)

You will receive the details of your user session within the CLI:

      Extensions:         permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Configure authentication preference

In the previous step we signed in to Teleport using GitHub credentials by
specifying GitHub as our auth type. By editing the `cluster_auth_preference`
resource we can make it the default auth type.

Edit the existing `cluster_auth_preference` resource using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl edit cap
```

A temporary file will open in your default editor with your `cluster_auth_preference` definition.

Ensure that `cap.yaml` includes the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  type: github
  webauthn:
    rp_id: 'example.teleport.sh'
version: v2
```

For `rp_id`, use the public address of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport
Cloud workspace.

When you save and close the temporary file, `tctl` will update the resource:

```code
#cluster auth preference has been updated
```

<Accordion title="Static configuration file">
  You can also edit your Teleport configuration file to include the following:

  ```yaml
  # Snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml
  auth_service:
    authentication:
      type: github
  ```
</Accordion>

After logging out of `tsh`, you can log back in without specifying
`--auth=github`. You will automatically be redirected to the GitHub auth flow.

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting SSO configuration can be challenging. Usually a Teleport administrator
must be able to:

- Be able to see what SAML/OIDC claims and values are getting exported and passed
  by the SSO provider to Teleport.
- Be able to see how Teleport maps the received claims to role mappings as defined
  in the connector.
- For self-hosted Teleport Enterprise clusters, ensure that HTTP/TLS
  certificates are configured properly for both the Teleport Proxy Service and
  the SSO provider.

If something is not working, we recommend to:

- Double-check the host names, tokens and TCP ports in a connector definition.

### Using the Web UI

If you get "access denied" or other login errors, the number one place to check is the Audit
Log. Under the **Management** area you can access it within the **Activity** tab in the
Teleport Web UI.

![Audit Log Entry for SSO Login error](../../../../assets/teleportauditlogssofailed-a5da7b0950.png)

Example of a user being denied because the role `clusteradmin` wasn't set up:

```json
{
  "code": "T1001W",
  "error": "role clusteradmin is not found",
  "event": "user.login",
  "method": "oidc",
  "success": false,
  "time": "2019-06-15T19:38:07Z",
  "uid": "cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"
}
```

### Teleport does not show the expected Nodes

When Teleport's Auth Service receives a request to list Teleport Nodes (e.g., to
display Nodes in the Web UI or via `tsh ls`), it only returns the Nodes that the
current user is authorized to view.

For each Node in the user's Teleport cluster, the Auth Service applies the
following checks in order and, if one check fails, hides the Node from the user:

- None of the user's roles contain a `deny` rule that matches the Node's labels.
- At least one of the user's roles contains an `allow` rule that matches the
  Node's labels.

If you are not seeing Nodes when expected, make sure that your user's roles
include the appropriate `allow` and `deny` rules as documented in the
[Teleport Access Controls Reference](/docs/access-controls/reference).

When configuring SSO, ensure that the identity provider is populating each user's
traits correctly. For a user to see a Node in Teleport, the result of populating a
template variable in a role's `allow.logins` must match at least one of a user's
`traits.logins`.

In this example a user will have usernames `ubuntu`, `debian` and usernames from the SSO trait `logins` for Nodes that have a `env: dev` label.  If the SSO trait username is `bob` then the usernames would include `ubuntu`, `debian`, and `bob`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['{{external.logins}}', ubuntu, debian]
    node_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
version: v5
```

### Single sign-on fails with OIDC

When encountering the error message **"Failed to verify JWT: oidc: unable to verify JWT signature: no matching keys"**, it typically indicates a discrepancy between the algorithm used to sign the JWT token and the algorithm(s) supported by the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). Specifically, the token might be signed with one algorithm, e.g., HS256, while the JWKS only lists keys for a different algorithm. e.g., RS256. This issue predominantly arises when using identity providers that offer extremely low-level functionality.

Here are some things to check:

- Verify the JWT header specifies the correct signing algorithm. This should match one of the algorithms listed in the keys section of the JWKS endpoint response.
- Ensure the JWKS endpoint is returning all relevant public keys. Sometimes key rotation can cause valid keys to be omitted.

To resolve the issue, align the JWT algorithm header with a supported algorithm in the JWKS. Rotate keys if necessary. Verify the JWKS only publishes the active public keys. With proper configuration, the signature should validate successfully.

### Teams Not Mapping to Roles

If you are not seeing teams mapping to roles as expected confirm you
are using the slug of the organizations and teams in the connector.
To create the slug, GitHub replaces special characters in the name string,
changes all words to lowercase, and replaces spaces with a `-` separator.
For example, "My TEam NÃ¤me" would become `my-team-name`.
The GitHub Web application URLs and GitHub API can provide the slug.

Example: navigate to the team `My Team` in the GitHub web application.
The URL `https://github.com/orgs/org-name/teams/my-team`
shows the slug is `my-team`. Update the teams to roles mapping.

```yaml
  teams_to_roles:
    - organization: my-org
      roles:
        - access
        - editor
        - reviewer
      team: my-team
```

## Next steps

The role we illustrated in this guide uses the `internal.logins` trait,
which Teleport replaces with values from the Teleport local user
database. For full details on how traits work in Teleport roles,
see the [Teleport Access Controls
Reference](/docs/access-controls/reference).
