<Tip>
  Teleport Access Graph is currently in Preview. Currently, it is only available
  to Teleport Team users, and only visualizes access to SSH servers enrolled with your Teleport clusters.
</Tip>

Teleport Access Graph visualizes and helps you understand access to your
infrastructure. It provides a visual representation of the relationships between
users, roles, and resources in your organization. It can help you answer
questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

After logging into the Teleport UI, go to the Management tab. If enabled, Access Graph options can be found
under the Permission Management section.

## Graph nodes

Teleport Access Graph divides your infrastructure into eight main components:

1. Users

![User Node](../../../assets/user-node-dbdbe55e4e.png)

Users are the people who access your infrastructure. They can be employees,
contractors, or bots.

2. User Groups

![User Group Node](../../../assets/user-group-node-0af076b2a8.png)

User Groups are collections of users. They can be used to organize users
based on their role or team.

3. Temporary user groups

![Temporary User Group Node](../../../assets/temporary-user-group-node-02500ef34b.png)

Temporary User Groups are created when a user is granted temporary access to a
resource. They are automatically deleted when the user's access expires.

4. Actions

![Action Node](../../../assets/allow-action-node-01fd0043d6.png)

Actions are the things that users can or cannot do. Actions are related to
resources. For example, a user can SSH into a node.

5. Deny Actions

![Deny Action Node](../../../assets/deny-action-node-239ba107c5.png)

Deny Actions are the things that users cannot do. Deny Actions are related to
resources. For example, a user cannot SSH into a node.

6. Temporary Actions

![Temporary Action Node](../../../assets/temporary-action-node-27cdbc4daa.png)

Temporary Actions are created when a user is granted temporary access to a
resource. They are automatically deleted when the user's access expires.

7. Resource Groups

![Resource Group Node](../../../assets/resource-group-node-9b9bd58801.png)

Resource Groups are collections of resources. They can be used to organize
resources based on their role or team.

8. Resources

![Resource Node](../../../assets/resource-node-8af80282dc.png)

Resources are the things that users can or cannot access. They can be
servers, databases, or Kubernetes clusters.

## Graph paths

Teleport Access Graph shows the relationships between users, roles, and
resources. It does this by showing paths between nodes. Paths are the
relationships between nodes. Paths always connect nodes in the following order:

1. Users
2. User Groups
3. Actions
4. Resource Groups
5. Resources

Paths can be divided into two categories:

1. Allow paths

![Allow Path](../../../assets/allow-path-f2cf80608a.png)

Allow paths connect users to resources. They show what a user can access
and what actions they can perform.

2. Deny paths

![Deny Path](../../../assets/deny-path-d43c34bd05.png)

Deny paths connect users to resources. They show what a user cannot access
and what actions they cannot perform. Deny paths take precedence over allow
paths.

## How to use it

Teleport Access Graph can help you to answer questions like:

- Who can access a specific resource?

- What resources can a specific user access?

## How Teleport resources are represented

Teleport Access Graph imports all Teleport resources and keeps them up to date, so every time you make a change
to your Teleport resources, the Access Graph will reflect those changes.

### Users

Users are created from Teleport Users.
Local users are imported as soon as they are created.
External users (created from authentication connectors for GitHub, SAML, etc.) are imported when they log in for the first time.

### User Groups

User Groups are created from Teleport Roles and access requests. Roles create User Groups where the members
are the users that have that role. Access requests create a temporary User Group where the members are the users that
got the access through the accepted access request.

### Actions

Actions are created from Teleport roles. Actions can be divided into three
categories:

1. Allow Actions

Allow Actions are created from Teleport roles. Allow Actions are the things
that users can do. For example, a user can SSH into a node.

2. Deny Actions

Deny Actions are created from Teleport roles. Deny Actions are the things
that users cannot do. For example, a user cannot SSH into a node. Deny
Actions take precedence over Allow Actions.

3. Temporary Actions

Temporary Actions are created when a user is granted temporary access to a
resource. They are automatically deleted when the user's access expires.

#### Resource Groups

Resource Groups are created from Teleport roles.

#### Resources

Resources are created from Teleport resources like nodes, databases, and
Kubernetes clusters. Currently, only SSH nodes are supported.
