These guides cover how to configure a deployed Machine ID to produce credentials
that can be used for machine to machine access to different Teleport resources.

It is a pre-requisite of these guides that Machine ID has been configured for
your platform, see the [Deploy Machine ID](/ver/16.x/machine-id/deployment) guides for information
on how to do so.
