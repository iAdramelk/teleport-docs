The guides in this section show you the fundamentals of setting up and running a
Teleport cluster. You will learn how to run the `teleport` daemon, manage users
and resources, and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

If you already understand how to set up a Teleport cluster, consult the
[Operations](/ver/16.x/management/operations) section so you can start conducting periodic
cluster maintenance tasks.
