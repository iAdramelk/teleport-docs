In Teleport, **local users** are users managed directly via Teleport, rather
than a third-party identity provider.

This guide shows you how to:

- [Add local users](/ver/16.x/management/admin/users#adding-local-users)
- [Edit existing users](/ver/16.x/management/admin/users#editing-users)
- [Delete users](/ver/16.x/management/admin/users#deleting-users)

## Prerequisites

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool, version >= 14.3.3.

      You can download these tools from the [Cloud Downloads page](/ver/16.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code

    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v14.3.3 go1.21
    Proxy version: 14.3.3
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see the Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/ver/16.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >=
      15.0.0-dev.

      You can download these tools by visiting your [Teleport
      account workspace](https://teleport.sh).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v15.0.0-dev git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v15.0.0-dev go1.21
    Proxy version: 15.0.0-dev
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you don't have an account,
      sign up to begin a [free trial](https://goteleport.com/signup/)  of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 14.3.3.

      You can download these tools from the [Cloud Downloads page](/ver/16.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads).

    To check version information, run the `tctl version` and `tsh version` commands.
    For example:

    ```code
    $ tctl version
    # Teleport Enterprise v14.3.3 git:api/14.0.0-gd1e081e go1.21
      
    $ tsh version
    # Teleport v14.3.3 go1.21
    Proxy version: 14.3.3
    Proxy: teleport.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then
  verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials.
  `tctl` is supported on macOS and Linux machines.

  For example:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  15.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
  current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
  If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that
  hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.

## Adding local users

A user identity in Teleport exists in the scope of a cluster.
A Teleport administrator creates Teleport user accounts and maps them to the roles they can use.

Let's look at this table:

| Teleport User | Allowed OS Logins | Description                                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `joe`         | `joe`, `root`     | Teleport user `joe` can log in to member Nodes as user `joe` or `root` on the OS.      |
| `bob`         | `bob`             | Teleport user `bob` can log in to member Nodes only as OS user `bob`.                  |
| `kim`         |                   | If no OS login is specified, it defaults to the same name as the Teleport user, `kim`. |

Let's add a new user to Teleport using the `tctl` tool:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Teleport Community Edition">
    ```code
    $ tctl users add joe --logins=joe,root --roles=access,editor
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Commercial">
    ```code
    $ tctl users add joe --logins=joe,root --roles=access,editor,reviewer
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Teleport generates an auto-expiring token (with a TTL of one hour) and prints
the token URL, which must be used before the TTL expires.

```code
User "joe" has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h:
https://<proxy_host>:443/web/invite/<token>

NOTE: Make sure <proxy_host>:443 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

The user completes registration by visiting this URL in their web browser,
picking a password, and configuring multi-factor authentication. If the
credentials are correct, the Teleport Auth Server generates and signs a new
certificate, and the client stores this key and will use it for subsequent
logins.

The key will automatically expire after 12 hours by default, after which
the user will need to log back in with their credentials. This TTL can be
configured to a different value.

Once authenticated, the account will become visible via `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl users ls

# User           Allowed Logins
# ----           --------------
# admin          admin,root
# kim            kim
# joe            joe,root
```

## Editing users

Admins can edit user entries via `tctl`.

For example, to see the full list of user records, an administrator can execute:

```code
$ tctl get users
```

To edit the user `joe`:

```code
# Dump the user definition into a file:
$ tctl get user/joe > joe.yaml
# ... edit the contents of joe.yaml

# Update the user record:
$ tctl create -f joe.yaml
```

## Deleting users

Admins can delete a local user via `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl users rm joe
```

    In addition to users, you can use `tctl` to manage roles and other dynamic
    resources. See our [Teleport Resources Reference](/ver/16.x/reference/resources).

    For all available `tctl` commands and flags, see our [CLI Reference](/ver/16.x/reference/cli/tctl).

    You can also configure Teleport so that users can log in using an SSO provider.
