Teleport manages graphical desktop access to remote hosts. With Teleport, you
get:

- A password-less login experience backed by strong cryptographic
  authentication.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for groups of hosts and users.
- Support for copying and pasting to and from remote hosts.
- Audit log and recording of all desktop connections.

<Note>
  Only Windows hosts accessible over RDP are supported. Specifically:

  | Teleport Version              | Windows Desktop                              | Active Directory |
