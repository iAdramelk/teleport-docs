title: Access Kubernetes Clusters with Teleport
description: Learn how Teleport can protect your Kubernetes clusters with RBAC, audit logging, and more.

Teleport provides secure access to Kubernetes clusters:

- Users can access Kubernetes clusters with Single Sign-On (SSO) providers like
  Okta and switch between clusters without logging in twice.
- Operators can implement granular role-based access controls, including
  limiting access to specific Kubernetes clusters or even specific pods within a
  namespace.
- Organizations can achieve compliance by recording `kubectl` sessions.

Here is an example of using Teleport to access a Kubernetes cluster, execute
commands, and view your `kubectl`  activity in Teleport's audit log:

## Get started

The fastest way to register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport is to deploy a
Teleport Kubernetes Service instance on the cluster you want to register.
We'll show you how to do this in our [Getting Started
Guide](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/getting-started).

## Automatically register Kubernetes clusters

Teleport can automatically discover Kubernetes clusters by communicating with
your cloud provider. When you create or destroy a Kubernetes cluster, Teleport
registers or deregisters the cluster so your access controls stay up to date
with your infrastructure.

[Read our overview](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/discovery) of how Teleport automatically discovers
Kubernetes clusters.

Read our guides to automatically registering Kubernetes clusters with Teleport
on your cloud:

- [AWS](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/discovery/aws)
- [Google Cloud](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/discovery/google-cloud)
- [Azure](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/discovery/azure)

## Manually register Kubernetes clusters

In some cases, you will want to register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport
manually when you create the cluster. There are a few ways to do this:

- [Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes
  Service with IAM Joining](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/iam-joining) on your cluster of
  choice.
- Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes Service outside your Kubernetes cluster (e.g.,
  directly on a virtual machine) and [give it access to a
  kubeconfig](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/static-kubeconfig).
- Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes Service outside of Kubernetes  and [use dynamic
  configuration resources](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/dynamic-registration) to
  register your clusters.

## Configure access to Kubernetes clusters

Once you register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport, you can apply fine-grained
access controls to manage the way users access your cluster.

Read our [Kubernetes RBAC guide](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/manage-access/rbac) for step-by-step
instructions on giving your users the correct access to Kubernetes clusters,
groups, users, and resources.

For a comprehensive reference to configuring access controls in your
Teleport-registered Kubernetes clusters, see our [Access Controls
Reference](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/controls).

See how to federate your Kubernetes access controls using [Teleport Trusted
Clusters](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/manage-access/federation).
