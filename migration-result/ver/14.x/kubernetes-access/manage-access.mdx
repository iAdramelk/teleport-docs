description: Use Teleport's sophisticated RBAC and Trusted Clusters to ensure that your teams have the correct access to your Kubernetes clusters.
version: '14.x'

Once you register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport, you can apply
sophisticated policies to manage the way users access your cluster.

Read our [Kubernetes RBAC guide](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/manage-access/rbac) for step-by-step
instructions on giving your users the correct access to Kubernetes clusters,
groups, users, and resources.

See how to federate your Kubernetes access controls using [Teleport Trusted
Clusters](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/manage-access/federation).

For a comprehensive reference to configuring access controls in your
Teleport-registered Kubernetes clusters, see our [Access Controls
Reference](/ver/14.x/kubernetes-access/controls).
