version: '14.x'
---

This guide shows you how to install Teleport binaries on your platform,
including:

- `teleport`
- `tsh`
- `tctl`
- `tbot`

If you are new to Teleport, we recommend following our [getting started
guide](/ver/14.x/index).

For best results, Teleport clients (`tsh`, `tctl`, `tbot`) should be the same major
version as the cluster they are connecting to. Teleport servers are compatible
with clients that are on the same major version or one major version older.
Teleport servers do not support clients that are on a newer major version.

See our [Upgrading](/ver/14.x/management/operations/upgrading) guide for more information.

## Operating system support

Teleport is officially supported on the platforms listed below. It is worth
noting that the open-source community has been successful in building and
running Teleport on UNIX variants other than Linux \[1].

| Operating System                                                   | `teleport` Daemon | `tctl` Admin Tool | `tsh` and Teleport Connect User Clients \[2] | Web UI (via the browser) | `tbot` Daemon |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Linux v2.6.23+ (RHEL/CentOS 7+, Ubuntu 14.04+, and Debian 8+) \[3] | yes               | yes               | yes                                          | yes                      | yes           |
| macOS v10.13+  (High Sierra)                                       | yes               | yes               | yes                                          | yes                      | yes           |
| Windows 10+ (rev. 1607) \[4]                                       | no                | no                | yes                                          | yes                      | no            |

\[1] *Teleport is written in Go and many of these system requirements are due to the requirements
of the [Go toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MinimumRequirements)*.

\[2] *`tsh` is a Command Line Client (CLI) and Teleport Connect is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) desktop client. See
[Using Teleport Connect](/ver/14.x/connect-your-client/teleport-connect) for usage and installation*.

\[3] *Enhanced Session Recording requires Linux kernel v5.8+*.

\[4] *Teleport server does not run on Windows yet, but `tsh` and Teleport Connect (the Teleport desktop clients)
supports most features on Windows 10 and later.*

## Linux

All installations include `teleport`, `tsh`, `tctl`, and `tbot`.

### Feature support

Some Teleport features have additional requirements:

| Feature                                                                            | Requirement   | Debian                   | Ubuntu   | CentOS/RHEL | Amazon Linux           |

<Note>
  `apt` and `yum` repos don't expose packages for all distribution variants.
  When following installation instructions, you might need to replace `ID` with
  `ID_LIKE` to install packages of the closest supported distribution.

  Currently supported distributions (and `ID`) are:

  - RHEL >= 7 (`rhel`)
  - CentOS >= 7 (`centos`)
  - Debian >= 8 (`debian`)
  - Ubuntu >= 16.04 (`ubuntu`)
  - Amazon Linux 2 and 2023 (`amzn`)
</Note>

### Installation instructions

<Accordion title="Before you begin: read security tips">
  When running Teleport in production, we recommend that you follow the
  practices below to avoid security incidents. These practices may differ from
  the examples used in this guide, which are intended for demo environments:

  - Avoid using `sudo` in production environments unless it's necessary.
  - Create new, non-root, users and use test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  - Run Teleport's services as a non-root user unless required. Only the SSH
    Service requires root access. Note that you will need root permissions (or
    the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability) to make Teleport listen on a port
    numbered \< `1024` (e.g. `443`).
  - Follow the "Principle of Least Privilege" (PoLP). Don't give users
    permissive roles when giving them more restrictive roles will do instead.
    For example, don't assign users the built-in `access,editor` roles, which give
    them permissions to access and edit all cluster resources. Instead, define
    RBAC roles with the minimum required permissions for each user and configure
    Access Requests for elevated permissions.
  - When joining a Teleport resource service (e.g., the Database Service or
    Application Service) to a cluster, save the invitation token to a file.
    Otherwise, the token will be visible when examining the `teleport` command
    that started the agent, e.g., via the `history` command on a compromised
    system.
</Accordion>

Use the appropriate commands for your environment to install your package:

    ```

    <Accordion title="Is my Teleport instance compatible with Teleport Team?">
      Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides
      v13, read our compatibility rules to ensure that the
      binary is compatible with Teleport Cloud.

      When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
      apply:

      - **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
        component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
        with any 8.3.0 component.
      - Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
        clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
        is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
        guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
        This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
        You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
      - Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
        an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
        default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
        when starting Proxy Services and resource services.

## Docker

### Images

We provide a pre-built Docker image for every version of Teleport. This section
describes the available Docker images.

These images are hosted on [Amazon ECR
Public](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

#### Image suffixes

For each of the image names listed in this section, you can specify attributes
of the image by appending a suffix to the repository name or tag.

Images with the `-distroless` suffix within the repository name include only the
`teleport` binary and its runtime dependencies, with no shell or utility
applications. An example is `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless`
for Teleport Community Edition.

Images with the `*-distroless-debug` suffix within the repository name include a
Busybox shell and tool suite in addition to Teleport, and are intended for
troubleshooting deployments only. They are not intended for production use. An
example is `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug`.

You can specify the architecture of an image by appending a suffix to its tag.
We support the following architecture suffixes: `amd64`, `arm`, and `arm64`. For
example, if you want to pull the ARM64 image for
`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport`, you can use
`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport:14.0.0-dev-arm64`.

`*-distroless` and `*-distroless-debug` images support multiple architectures
natively, and do not require (or support) image suffixes. You can specify an
architecture using the `--platform` flag of `docker pull` to pull the `arm`,
`arm64` or `amd64` version of an image.

#### Version tags

Images point to a static version of Teleport. Use the image's tag to specify
either:

- The major, minor, and patch version (e.g., `14.0.0-dev` for the
  latest version of Teleport Community Edition).
- The major version only, which implies the latest minor and patch numbers for
  that major version. For example, `14` implies
  `14.0.0-dev`.

### Running Teleport on Docker

When running a container from one of the images listed above, consider the
container equivalent to running the `teleport` binary. The Teleport container
requires access to a file system and network ports.

#### Configuration

Teleport processes read their configuration from a local file path, which is
`/etc/teleport.yaml` by default. Make sure this file path is mounted to your
Teleport container.

#### Data directory

All Teleport processes read from and write to a data directory, which by default
is `/var/lib/teleport`. Make sure the data directory is mounted to your Teleport
container.

#### License file

If your Teleport Enterprise container runs the Auth Service, you will need to
give it access to a license file at the path named in the configuration, which
is `/var/lib/teleport/license.pem` by default. Make sure a license exists at
this location in the Teleport container's data directory.

#### Other file paths

Depending on the configuration settings you assign on your Teleport container,
you will need to make sure that any file paths you name are mounted on the
container.

For example, if you are running the Teleport Proxy Service on a container, you
need to mount the directory containing TLS credentials to your Teleport
container, then assign the following fields in the container's configuration
file to the appropriate paths:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /my/path/key.pem
    cert_file: /my/path/cert.pem
```

See the Teleport [Configuration Reference](/ver/14.x/reference/config) for whether a
field you would like to assign requires a file path.

#### Ports

A single Teleport process can run multiple services, each of which listens on a
specific set of ports depending on your configuration. See our [Networking
Reference](/ver/14.x/reference/networking#ports) for the ports on your Teleport
container to expose.

### Example of running a Teleport container

In this example, we will show you how to run the Teleport Auth and Proxy
Services on a local Docker container using Teleport Community Edition.

Since this container uses a self-signed certificate, we do not recommend using
this configuration to protect any infrastructure outside your workstation. You
can, however, join other local Docker containers to it using the [token
method](/ver/14.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token).

First, create directories in your home directory to mount to the container. The
Teleport container will write its configuration and data to these directories:

```code
$ mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data
```

Run `teleport configure` from the Teleport container to generate a configuration
file. This sets the container's name to `localhost` so your browser can trust
the Proxy Service's self-signed TLS certificate:

```code
$ docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/teleport \
  public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless:12.1.5 configure --roles=proxy,auth > ~/teleport/config/teleport.yaml
```

Start Teleport on your container:

```code
$ docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless:12.1.5
```

From there, open another terminal and make sure your Teleport container's web
API is functioning as intended:

```code
$ curl --insecure https://localhost:3080/webapi/ping
```

You should see JSON output similar to the following:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "local",
    "second_factor": "otp",
    "preferred_local_mfa": "otp",
    "local": {
      "name": ""
    },
    "private_key_policy": "none",
    "device_trust_disabled": true,
    "has_motd": false
  },
  "proxy": {
    "kube": {
      "enabled": true,
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "ssh": {
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "web_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "db": {
      "postgres_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "tls_routing_enabled": true
  },
  "server_version": "12.1.5",
  "min_client_version": "11.0.0",
  "cluster_name": "localhost",
  "automatic_upgrades": false
}
```

We are using the `--insecure` flag to trust Teleport's self-signed certificate.
In production, you will want to provision TLS credentials to the Proxy Service
from a trusted CA, e.g., Let's Encrypt.

## Helm

To allow Helm to install charts that are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository, use `helm repo add`:

```code
$ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
```

To update the cache of charts from the remote repository, run `helm repo update`:

```code
$ helm repo update
```

There are two charts available to install. Please see our guide for using each
chart.

      <Tab title="Homebrew">
        <Note>
          The Teleport package in Homebrew is not maintained by Teleport and we can't
          guarantee its reliability or security.
        </Note>

        ### Warnings

        We recommend the use of our [official
        Teleport packages](https://goteleport.com/download). Binaries provided by Homebrew
        are not signed by Teleport, so features that require signed and notarized binaries
        (TouchID, Device Trust) are not available in Homebrew builds.

        The `tctl` release available on Homebrew is the open source edition, and
        cannot manage configuration resources unique to Teleport Enterprise and
        Teleport Enterprise Cloud (e.g., OIDC and SAML connectors). For Teleport
        Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud, we recommend installing the official Teleport
        Enterprise edition of `tctl`.

        ### Installing open source Teleport with Homebrew

        To install Teleport with Homebrew, run the following command:

        ```code
        $ brew install teleport
        ```

        If you choose to use Homebrew, you must verify that the versions of `tsh`
        and `tctl` you run on your local machine are compatible with the versions
        you run on your infrastructure. Homebrew usually ships the latest release of
        Teleport, which may be incompatible with older versions. See our
        [compatibility policy](/ver/14.x/management/operations/upgrading) for details.

        To verify versions, log in to your cluster and compare the output of `tctl status`
        against `tsh version` and `tctl version`.

## Windows (tsh client only)

Most `tsh` features are supported for Windows 10 1607+. The `tsh ssh` command
can be run under `cmd.exe`, PowerShell, and Windows Terminal.

To install `tsh` on Windows, run the following commands in **PowerShell** (these commands will not work in `cmd.exe`):

## Building from source

Teleport is written in Go, and currently requires **go v1.20** or
newer. Detailed instructions for building from source are available in the
[README](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport#building-teleport).

## Checksums

If you want to verify the integrity of a Teleport binary, SHA256 checksums are
available for all downloads on our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/download/).

![Teleport Checksum](../../../assets/teleport-sha-81ff1209cc.png)

If you download Teleport via an automated system, you can programmatically
obtain the checksum by adding `.sha256` to the download link. This is the method
shown in the installation examples.

```code
$ export version=v14.0.0-dev
# 'darwin' 'linux' or 'windows'
$ export os=linux
# '386' 'arm' on linux or 'amd64' for all distros
$ export arch=amd64
$ curl https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-$version-$os-$arch-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
```
