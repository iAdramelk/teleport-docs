Server access involves managing your resources, configuring new clusters, and
issuing commands through a CLI or programmatically to an API.

This guide introduces some of these common scenarios and how to interact with
Teleport to accomplish them:

1. SSH into a cluster using Teleport.
2. Introspect the cluster using Teleport features.

<Tip>
  This guide also demonstrates how to configure Teleport Nodes using the **bastion
  pattern** so that only a single Node can be accessed publicly.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Before you begin: read security tips">
  When running Teleport in production, we recommend that you follow the
  practices below to avoid security incidents. These practices may differ from
  the examples used in this guide, which are intended for demo environments:

  - Avoid using `sudo` in production environments unless it's necessary.
  - Create new, non-root, users and use test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  - Run Teleport's services as a non-root user unless required. Only the SSH
    Service requires root access. Note that you will need root permissions (or
    the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability) to make Teleport listen on a port
    numbered \< `1024` (e.g. `443`).
  - Follow the "Principle of Least Privilege" (PoLP). Don't give users
    permissive roles when giving them more restrictive roles will do instead.
    For example, don't assign users the built-in `access,editor` roles, which give
    them permissions to access and edit all cluster resources. Instead, define
    RBAC roles with the minimum required permissions for each user and configure
    Access Requests for elevated permissions.
  - When joining a Teleport resource service (e.g., the Database Service or
    Application Service) to a cluster, save the invitation token to a file.
    Otherwise, the token will be visible when examining the `teleport` command
    that started the agent, e.g., via the `history` command on a compromised
    system.
</Accordion>

## Step 1/4. Install Teleport on your Linux host

1. Your Linux host will be a private resource. Open port 22 so you can initially
   access, configure, and provision your instance.

   We'll configure and launch our instance, then demonstrate how to use the
   `tsh` tool and Teleport in SSH mode.

2. On the host where you will run the Teleport SSH Service, follow the instructions
   for your environment to install Teleport.

   Use the appropriate commands for your environment to install your package:

       ```

       <Accordion title="Is my Teleport instance compatible with Teleport Team?">
         Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides
         v13, read our compatibility rules to ensure that the
         binary is compatible with Teleport Cloud.

         When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
         apply:

         - **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
           component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
           with any 8.3.0 component.
         - Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
           clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
           is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
           guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
           This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
           You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
         - Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
           an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
           default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
           when starting Proxy Services and resource services.

         Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides v13,

   Next, we'll create a **join token** so you can start the Teleport SSH Service
   and add it to your cluster.

## Step 2/4. Add a server to the cluster

### Create a join token

On your local workstation, create a join token so you can add the server to your
Teleport cluster:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```code
    Let's save the token to a file
    $ tctl tokens add --type=node --format=text > token.file
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```code
    Let's save the token to a file
    $ tctl tokens add --type=node --format=text > token.file
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

`--type=node` specifies that the Teleport process will act and join as an SSH
server.

`> token.file` indicates that you'd like to save the output to a file name `token.file`.

<Tip>
  This helps to minimize the direct sharing of tokens even when they are dynamically generated.
</Tip>

### Join your server to the cluster

On your server, save `token.file` to an appropriate, secure, directory you have
the rights and access to read. Next, generate a configuration file enabling
Teleport's SSH Service.

Change `tele.example.com` to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service. Assign
the `--token` flag to the path where you saved `token.file`.

```code
# Generate config
$ sudo teleport node configure \
   --output=file:///etc/teleport.yaml \
   --token=/path/to/token.file \
   --proxy=tele.example.com:443
```

Change `mytenant.teleport.sh` to your Teleport Cloud tenant address. Assign the
`--token` flag to the path where you saved `token.file`.

```code
# Generate config
$ sudo teleport node configure \
   --output=file:///etc/teleport.yaml \
   --token=/path/to/token.file \
   --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh:443
```

The `teleport node configure` command above placed a configuration file at
`/etc/teleport.yaml`. The last step is to start Teleport, pointing it at this
configuration:

Configure the Teleport SSH Service to start automatically when the host boots up by
creating a systemd service for it. The instructions depend on how you installed
the Teleport SSH Service.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Package Manager">
    On the host where you will run the Teleport SSH Service, enable and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TAR Archive">
    On the host where you will run the Teleport SSH Service, create a systemd service
    configuration for Teleport, enable the Teleport service, and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of the Teleport SSH Service with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

### Access the Web UI

Run the following command to create a user that can access the Teleport Web UI:

```code
$ tctl users add myuser --roles=editor,access,reviewer --logins=root,ubuntu,ec2-user
```

This will generate an initial login link where you can create a password and set
up two-factor authentication for `myuser`.

<Note>
  We've only given `myuser` the roles `editor` and `access` according to the
  Principle of Least Privilege.
</Note>

You should now be able to view your server in the Teleport Web UI after
logging in as `myuser`:

![Both servers in the Web UI](../../../../assets/teleport_ui-35f52ccbd4.png)

## Step 3/4. SSH into the server

Now that we've got our cluster up and running, let's see how easy it is to
connect to our server.

We can use `tsh` to SSH into the cluster:

### Log in to the cluster

On your local machine, log in to your cluster through `tsh`, assigning the
`--proxy` flag to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
# Log in through tsh
$ tsh login --proxy=tele.example.com --user=myuser
```

On your local machine, log in to your cluster through `tsh`, assigning the
`--proxy` flag to the address of your Teleport Cloud tenant:

```code
# Log in through tsh
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh:443 --user=myuser
```

You'll be prompted to supply the password and second factor we set up
previously.

`myuser` will now see something similar to:

```txt
> Profile URL:      https://tele.example.com:443
Logged in as:       myuser
Cluster:            tele.example.com
Roles:              access, editor
Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
Kubernetes:         disabled
Valid until:        2021-04-30 06:39:13 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

In this example, `myuser` is now logged into the `tele.example.com` cluster
through Teleport SSH.

```txt
> Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
Logged in as:       myuser
Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
Roles:              access, editor
Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
Kubernetes:         disabled
Valid until:        2021-04-30 06:39:13 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

In this example, `myuser` is now logged into the `mytenant.teleport.sh`
cluster through Teleport SSH.

### Display cluster resources

`myuser` can now execute the following to find the cluster's server names,
which are used for establishing SSH connections:

```code
# Display cluster resources
$ tsh ls
```

In this example, the bastion host is located on the bottom line below:

```txt
Node Name        Address        Labels
---------------- -------------- --------------------------------------
ip-172-31-35-170 ⟵ Tunnel
ip-172-31-41-144 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example, hostname=ip-172-31-41-144
```

### Connect to a server

`myuser` can SSH into the bastion host server by running the following command locally:

```code
# Use tsh to ssh into a server
$ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-41-144
```

Now, they can:

- Connect to other servers in the cluster by using the appropriate IP address in
  the `tsh ssh` command.
- Traverse the Linux file system.
- Execute desired commands.

All commands executed by `myuser` are recorded and can be replayed in the
Teleport Web UI.

The `tsh ssh` command allows users to do anything they could if they were to SSH
into a server using a third-party tool. Compare the two equivalent commands:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="tsh">
    ```code
    $ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-41-144
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ssh">
    To use the `ssh` client generate a SSH configuration file and postfix
    the cluster name after the node name.

    ```code
    $ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
    $ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport root@ip-172-31-41-144.tele.example.com
    ```

    ```code
    $ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
    $ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport root@ip-172-31-41-144.mytenant.teleport.sh
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Use tsh and the unified resource catalog to introspect the cluster

Now, `myuser` has the ability to SSH into other servers within the cluster,
traverse the Linux file system, and execute commands.

- They have visibility into all resources within the cluster due to their
  defined and assigned roles.
- They can also quickly view any server or grouping of servers that have been
  assigned a particular label.

### Display the unified resource catalog

Execute the following command within your bastion host console:

```code
# List servers
$ tctl nodes ls
```

This displays the unified resource catalog with all queried resources in one
view:

```txt
Nodename         UUID                                 Address        Labels
---------------- ------------------------------------ -------------- -------------------------------------
ip-172-31-35-170 4980899c-d260-414f-9aea-874feef71747
ip-172-31-41-144 f3d2a65f-3fa7-451d-b516-68d189ff9ae5 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example,hostname=ip-172-31-41-144
```

Note the "Labels" column on the farthest side. `myuser` can query all
resources with a shared label using the command:

```code
# Query all servers with a label
$ tsh ls env=example
```

Customized labels can be defined in your `teleport.yaml` configuration file or
during server creation.

This is a convenient feature that allows for more advanced queries. If an IP
address changes, for example, an admin can quickly find the current server with
that label since it remains unchanged.

### Run commands on all servers with a label

`myuser` can also execute commands on all servers that share a label, vastly
simplifying repeated operations. For example, the following command will execute
the `ls` command on each server and display the results in your terminal:

```code
# Run the ls command on all servers with a label
$ tsh ssh root@env=example ls
```

## Optional: Harden your bastion host

We previously configured our Linux instance to leave port `22` open to easily
configure and install Teleport. Feel free to compare Teleport SSH to your usual
`ssh` commands.

If you'd like to further experiment with using Teleport according to the bastion
pattern:

- Close port `22` on your private Linux instance now that your Teleport server is
  configured and running.
- For self-hosted deployments, optionally close port `22` on your bastion host.
- You'll be able to fully connect to the private instance and, for self-hosted
  deployments, the bastion host, using `tsh ssh`.

## Conclusion

To recap, this guide described:

1. How to set up and add an SSH server to a cluster.
2. Connect to the cluster using `tsh` to manage and introspect resources.

Feel free to shut down, clean up, and delete your resources, or use them in
further Getting Started exercises.
