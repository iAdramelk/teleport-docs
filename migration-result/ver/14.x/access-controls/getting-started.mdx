In Teleport, any local, SSO, or robot user can be assigned one or several roles.
Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, Windows
desktops, and web apps.

We will start with local users and preset roles, assign roles to SSO users, and
wrap up with creating your own role.

</Tabs>

- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  {/* Ignoring scope linting since we use this partial throughout the docs and
  cannot guarantee that it will line up with a page's configured scopes*/}
  {/*lint ignore scopes*/}
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  14.0.0-dev
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  {/*lint ignore scopes*/}
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

<Accordion title="Before you begin: read security tips">
  When running Teleport in production, we recommend that you follow the
  practices below to avoid security incidents. These practices may differ from
  the examples used in this guide, which are intended for demo environments:

  - Avoid using `sudo` in production environments unless it's necessary.
  - Create new, non-root, users and use test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  - Run Teleport's services as a non-root user unless required. Only the SSH
    Service requires root access. Note that you will need root permissions (or
    the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability) to make Teleport listen on a port
    numbered \< `1024` (e.g. `443`).
  - Follow the "Principle of Least Privilege" (PoLP). Don't give users
    permissive roles when giving them more restrictive roles will do instead.
    For example, don't assign users the built-in `access,editor` roles, which give
    them permissions to access and edit all cluster resources. Instead, define
    RBAC roles with the minimum required permissions for each user and configure
    Access Requests for elevated permissions.
  - When joining a Teleport resource service (e.g., the Database Service or
    Application Service) to a cluster, save the invitation token to a file.
    Otherwise, the token will be visible when examining the `teleport` command
    that started the agent, e.g., via the `history` command on a compromised
    system.
</Accordion>

## Step 1/3. Add local users with preset roles

Teleport provides several preset roles: `editor`, `auditor`, and `access`.

- The `editor` role authorizes users to modify cluster configuration.
- The `auditor` role authorizes users to view audit logs.
- The `access` role authorizes users to access cluster resources.

<Accordion title="Enterprise built in roles">
  Teleport Enterprise contains two additional preset roles: `reviewer` and `requester`.

  - The `reviewer` role authorizes users to review Access Requests.
  - The `requester` role authorizes users to request resources.
</Accordion>

Invite the local user Alice as cluster `editor`:

```code
$ tctl users add alice --roles=editor
```

Invite the local user Alice as cluster `editor` and `reviewer`:

```code
$ tctl users add alice --roles=editor,reviewer
```

Once Alice signs up, she will be able to edit cluster configuration. You can list
users and their roles using `tctl users ls`.

```code
$ tctl users ls

# User                 Roles
# -------------------- --------------
# alice                editor
```

```code
$ tctl users ls

# User                 Roles
# -------------------- --------------
# alice                editor, reviewer
```

You can update the user's roles using the `tctl users update` command:

```code
# Once Alice logs back in, she will be able to view audit logs
$ tctl users update alice --set-roles=editor,auditor
```

```code
# Once Alice logs back in, she will be able to view audit logs
$ tctl users update alice --set-roles=editor,reviewer,auditor
```

Because Alice has two or more roles, permissions from those roles create a union. She
will be able to act as a system administrator and auditor at the same time.

## Step 2/3. Map SSO users to roles

Next, follow the instructions to set up an authentication connector that maps
users within your SSO solution to Teleport roles.

Save the file below as `github.yaml` and update the fields. You will need to
set up a
[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Connector](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)
app. Any member belonging to the GitHub organization `octocats` and on team
`admin` will be able to assume the built-in role `access`.

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
  name: github
spec:
  # client ID of GitHub OAuth app
  client_id: client-id
  # client secret of GitHub OAuth app
  client_secret: client-secret
  # This name will be shown on UI login screen
  display: GitHub
  # Change tele.example.com to your domain name
  redirect_url: https://tele.example.com:443/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # Map github teams to teleport roles
  teams_to_roles:
    - organization: octocats # GitHub organization name
      team: admin            # GitHub team name within that organization
      # map github admin team to Teleport's "access" role
      roles: ["access"]
```

Create the `github` resource:

```code
$ tctl create github.yaml
```

Create a SAML or OIDC application that Teleport can integrate with, then
create an authentication connector that maps users within your application to
Teleport roles.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SAML">
    Follow our [SAML Okta Guide](/ver/14.x/access-controls/sso/okta) to
    create a SAML application.

    Save the file below as `okta.yaml` and update the `acs` field.
    Any member in Okta group `okta-admin` will assume a built-in role `admin`.

    ```yaml
    kind: saml
    version: v2
    metadata:
      name: okta
    spec:
      acs: https://tele.example.com/v1/webapi/saml/acs
      attributes_to_roles:
      - {name: "groups", value: "okta-admin", roles: ["access"]}
      entity_descriptor: |
        <?xml !!! Make sure to shift all lines in XML descriptor
        with 4 spaces, otherwise things will not work
    ```

    Create the `saml` resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl create okta.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    Follow our [OIDC guides](/ver/14.x/access-controls/sso/oidc#identity-providers) to
    create an OIDC application.

    Copy the YAML below to a file called `oidc.yaml` and edit the information to
    include the details of your OIDC application.

    ```yaml
    #
    # Example resource for an OIDC connector
    # We recommend using OIDC for G Suite, Auth0 and Keycloak
    #
    kind: oidc
    version: v2
    metadata:
      name: new_oidc_connector
    spec:
      redirect_url: "https://<cluster-url>/v1/webapi/oidc/callback"
      client_id: <client id>
      # connector display name that will be appended to the title of "Login with"
      # button on the cluster login screen so it will say "Login with Google".
      # Teleport will provide custom CSS for 'Google'.
      display: Google
      client_secret: <client secret>
      issuer_url: https://<issuer-url>
      scope: [<scope value>]
      claims_to_roles:
        - {claim: "hd", value: "example.com", roles: ["editor"]}

    ```

    Create the `oidc` resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl create okta.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Create a custom role

Let's create a custom role for interns. Interns will have access
to test or staging SSH servers as `readonly` users. We will let them
view some monitoring web applications and dev kubernetes cluster.

Save this role as `interns.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: interns
spec:
  allow:
    # Logins configures SSH login principals
    logins: ['readonly']
    # Assigns users with this role to the built-in Kubernetes group "view"
    kubernetes_groups: ["view"]
    # Allow access to SSH nodes, Kubernetes clusters, apps or databases
    # labeled with "staging" or "test"
    node_labels:
      'env': ['staging', 'test']
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "*"
        name: "*"
    app_labels:
      'type': ['monitoring']
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    # deny access to any Node, database, app or Kubernetes cluster labeled
    # as prod as any user.
    node_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "prod"
        name: "*"
    db_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    app_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

Create a role using the `tctl create -f` command:

```code
$ tctl create -f /tmp/interns.yaml
# Get a list of all roles in the system
$ tctl get roles --format text
```
