## Overview

Teleport can partition compute infrastructure into multiple clusters. A cluster
is a group of Teleport connected resources. Each cluster
manages a set of certificate authorities (CAs) for its users and resources.

Trusted Clusters allow the users of one cluster, the **root cluster**, to
seamlessly SSH into the Nodes of another cluster, the **leaf cluster**, while
remaining authenticated with only a single Auth Service. The leaf cluster can
be running behind a firewall without any ingress ports open.

Uses for Trusted Clusters include:

- Managed service providers (MSP) remotely managing the infrastructure of their clients.
- Device manufacturers remotely maintaining computing appliances deployed on premises.
- Large cloud software vendors managing multiple data centers.

<Tip>
  Individual nodes and proxies can create reverse tunnels to proxy services without creating a new cluster.
  You don't need to set up a trusted cluster just to connect a couple of servers, kubernetes clusters or
  databases behind a firewall.
</Tip>

## Multi-Data-center Clusters

In the example below, there are three independent clusters:

- Cluster `sso.example.com` is a root cluster. This cluster can be used as a single-sign-on entry point
  for your organization. It can have it's own independent resources connected to it, or be used just for audit
  logs collection and single-sign-on.
- Clusters `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b` are two independent clusters in different availability zones.

## Role Mapping

In Teleport, leaf clusters are autonomous - they have their own state, roles and even local users.
Leaf clusters have autonomy to decide how to map identity of the external users to their local roles.
We call this process role mapping. Take a look at the flow below to understand how it works:

<Tip>
  If this all sounds complicated, but don't worry, you do not need to use trusted clusters unless you have
  large, distributed infrastructure or your organization works with external agencies or contractors who
  need separate access.

  In many cases, a single cluster is enough. A single teleport cluster can scale to hundreds of thousands
  of connected resources!

## Next steps

Read the rest of the Architecture Guides:

- See how Teleport uses [Certificates](/ver/13.x/architecture/authentication) for authentication.
- Reduce your surface of attack using [TLS routing](/ver/13.x/architecture/tls-routing).
- Follow our [guide](/ver/13.x/management/admin/trustedclusters) to set up trusted clusters.
