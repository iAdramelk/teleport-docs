Machine ID is a service that programmatically issues and renews short-lived
certificates to any service account (e.g., a CI/CD server) by retrieving
credentials from the Teleport Auth Service. This enables fine-grained
role-based access controls and audit.

Machine ID supports the following Teleport features:

- [Server Access](/ver/13.x/machine-id/getting-started)
- [Database Access](/ver/13.x/machine-id/guides/databases)
- [Kubernetes Access](/ver/13.x/machine-id/guides/kubernetes) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
- [Application Access](/ver/13.x/machine-id/guides/applications) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
  - Note: [AWS Console](/ver/13.x/application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console) and API access are currently unsupported.
- [Teleport API Access](/ver/13.x/api/introduction)

These features are supported in Teleport Enterprise and Teleport Cloud.

The following features are **not** yet supported by Machine ID:

- [Desktop Access](/ver/13.x/desktop-access/introduction)
- [User Impersonation](/ver/13.x/access-controls/guides/impersonation): Machine
  ID uses Role Impersonation which cannot be combined with User Impersonation
- Multifactor authentication like [WebAuthn](/ver/13.x/access-controls/guides/webauthn) and [Passwordless](/ver/13.x/access-controls/guides/passwordless)
- [AWS Console Access](/ver/13.x/application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console)
