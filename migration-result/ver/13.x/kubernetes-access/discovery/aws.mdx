title: Teleport EKS Auto-Discovery (Preview)
description: How to configure auto-discovery of AWS EKS clusters in Teleport.
version: '13.x'
---

EKS Auto-Discovery can automatically
discover any EKS cluster and enroll it in Teleport if its tags match the
configured labels.

Teleport Kubernetes Auto-Discovery involves two components.

The first, the Discovery Service, is responsible for watching your cloud
provider and checking if there are any new clusters or if there have been any
modifications to previously discovered clusters. The second, the Kubernetes
Service, monitors the clusters created by the Discovery Service. It proxies
communications between users and the API servers of these clusters.

<Tip>
  This guide presents the Discovery Service and Kubernetes Service running in the
  same process, however both can run independently and on different machines.

  For example, you can run an instance of the Kubernetes Service in each
  Kubernetes cluster you want to register with Teleport, and an instance of the
  Discovery Service in any network you wish.

- An AWS account with permissions to create and attach IAM policies.
- An AWS account with `system:masters` RBAC access to EKS clusters.
- A host to run the Teleport Discovery and Kubernetes services.
- One or more EKS clusters running.

## Known limitations

Due to the authorization method that AWS has chosen for EKS clusters, it is not
possible for the Teleport process to configure the necessary permissions to forward
requests to EKS clusters.
This limitation exists because the authorization method on EKS clusters requires that the IAM role -
used for authentication - exists in the
[`aws-auth`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html) `ConfigMap`.

In this `ConfigMap`, IAM roles are mapped to Kubernetes RBAC users or groups that are then
used by Kubernetes RBAC to grant access permissions. If the mapping does not exist, it results in
unauthorized requests. Therefore, Teleport cannot edit the `ConfigMap`
without first having access to the cluster.

If Teleport is not running with the same IAM identity that creates all clusters,
please ensure you configure the required permissions as described in Step 2.

<Note>
  The AWS EKS team is working on a feature request to introduce an external API to manage access to the cluster without manually editing the Configmap ([aws/containers-roadmap#185](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/185)).

  Hopefully, once the feature is available, Teleport can leverage it to configure its access to the cluster.
</Note>

## Step 1/3. Set up AWS IAM credentials

For Teleport to discover EKS clusters, the instance
running the Discovery Service requires an IAM policy that allows Teleport to list and
describe EKS clusters:

```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "eks:ListClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 2/3. Configure EKS cluster authorization

When the Kubernetes Service uses an IAM role that is different from the one that
creates the clusters, you need to configure the mapping between the Teleport IAM
Role and the Kubernetes RBAC permissions by editing the `aws-auth` `Configmap` on
each of the discovered clusters.

To forward requests to the Kubernetes cluster, the Teleport Kubernetes Service
requires cluster-wide permissions to `Impersonate` RBAC users and groups, to
create `SelfSubjectAccessReviews` and `SelfSubjectRulesReviews`, and, finally,
read access to `Pods`.

If your Kubernetes cluster does not have an RBAC group with the required
permissions, you can create the `ClusterRole`, `ClusterRoleBinding`, and the
mapping by following the Creating RBAC group guide.
If your cluster already has an RBAC group that satisfies the required permissions,
you can reuse it and map it into the IAM Role used by the Teleport Kubernetes
Service. For simplicity, it is also possible to map the Teleport IAM role onto
a built-in Kubernetes RBAC group like `system:masters`, but not recommended in
production.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Creating RBAC group">
    Connect to your target cluster with your credentials and create the following
    resources using `kubectl`.

    ### ClusterRole

    Create the `ClusterRole` RBAC definition with the required permissions for Teleport
    Kubernetes Service to forward requests to the cluster.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: teleport
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - users
      - groups
      - serviceaccounts
      verbs:
      - impersonate
    - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - pods
      verbs:
      - get
    - apiGroups:
      - "authorization.k8s.io"
      resources:
      - selfsubjectaccessreviews
      - selfsubjectrulesreviews
      verbs:
      - create
    ```

    ### ClusterRoleBinding

    Link the previously created `ClusterRole` into a `teleport` RBAC group.

    ```yaml
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: teleport
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: teleport
    subjects:
    - kind: Group
      name: teleport
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

    ### IAM mapping

    Finally, edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append
    the following to `mapRoles`. Replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the
    appropriate IAM role that Teleport Kubernetes Service will use.
    This step will link the Teleport IAM role into the Kubernetes RBAC group `teleport`,
    allowing Teleport Kubernetes Service to forward requests into the cluster.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      mapRoles: |
        - groups:
          - teleport
          rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
          username: teleport
    ```

    At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions
    to forward requests to the cluster.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reuse an existing RBAC Group">
    To associate the Teleport IAM role with an existing Kubernetes RBAC group,
    edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append
    the following to `mapRoles`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      mapRoles: |
      ...
        - groups:
          - {rbac_group}
          rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
          username: teleport
    ```

    Please replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the appropriate IAM role that
    Teleport Kubernetes Service is using and `{rbac_group}` with the existing Kubernetes
    RBAC Group that satisfies the required permissions.

    At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions
    to forward requests to the cluster.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use system:masters">
    <Warning>
      Granting the `system:masters` group to the IAM role associated with the Teleport
      service means granting administrator-level permissions on the Kubernetes cluster.
      To follow least privilege principle we do not recommend using this method in production.
    </Warning>

    To associate the Teleport IAM role with the `system:masters` RBAC group,
    edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append
    the following to `mapRoles`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      mapRoles: |
      ...
        - groups:
          - system:masters
          rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
          username: teleport
    ```

    Please replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the appropriate IAM role that
    Teleport Kubernetes Service is using.

    At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions
    to forward requests to the cluster.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  If you provision your EKS clusters using tools such as `terraform`, `eksctl` or
  `Cloudformation`, you can use them to automatically configure the `aws-auth` `Configmap`
  and create the `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources during cluster provisioning.
</Tip>

## Step 3/3. Configure Teleport to discover EKS clusters

### Get a join token

Teleport EKS Auto-Discovery requires a valid Teleport auth token for the Discovery and
Kubernetes services to join the cluster. Generate one by running the following
command against your Teleport Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the
machine that will run Kubernetes Auto-Discovery:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery,kube
```

### Configure the Teleport Kubernetes and Discovery Services

<Warning>
  Discovery Service exposes a configuration parameter - `discovery_service.discovery_group` -
  that allows you to group discovered resources into different sets. This parameter
  is used to prevent Discovery Agents watching different sets of cloud resources
  from colliding against each other and deleting resources created by another services.

  When running multiple Discovery Services, you must ensure that each service is configured
  with the same `discovery_group` value if they are watching the same cloud resources
  or a different value if they are watching different cloud resources.

  It is possible to run a mix of configurations in the same Teleport cluster meaning
  that some Discovery Services can be configured to watch the same cloud resources
  while others watch different resources. As an example, a 4-agent high availability
  configuration analyzing data from two different cloud accounts would run with
  the following configuration.

  - 2 Discovery Services configured with `discovery_group: "prod"` polling data
    from Production account.
  - 2 Discovery Services configured with `discovery_group: "staging"` polling data
    from Staging account.
</Warning>

Enabling EKS Auto-Discovery requires that the `discovery_service.aws` section
include at least one entry and that `discovery_service.aws.types` include `eks`.
It also requires configuring the `kubernetes_service.resources.tags` to use the same
labels configured at `discovery_service.aws.tags` or a subset of them to make
the Kubernetes Service listen to the dynamic resources created by the Discovery
Service.

```yaml
version: v2
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  auth_servers:
  - "teleport.example.com:3080"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  discovery_group: "aws-prod"
  aws:
   - types: ["eks"]
     regions: ["*"]
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EKS cluster tags where tag:env=prod
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "env": "prod" # Match Kubernetes Cluster labels specified earlier
```

### Start the Kubernetes and Discovery Services

Grant the Kubernetes and Discovery Services access to credentials that it can use to authenticate to
AWS. If you are running the Kubernetes and Discovery Services on an EC2 instance, you should use the EC2
Instance Metadata Service method. Otherwise, you must use environment variables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Instance Metadata Service">
    Teleport will detect when it is running on an EC2 instance and use the Instance
    Metadata Service to fetch credentials.

    The EC2 instance should be configured to use an EC2 instance profile. For more
    information, see: [Using Instance Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Environment Variables">
    Teleport's built-in AWS client reads credentials from the following environment
    variables:

    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

    When you start the Kubernetes and Discovery Services, the service reads environment variables from a
    file at the path `/etc/default/teleport`. Obtain these credentials from your
    organization. Ensure that `/etc/default/teleport` has the following content,
    replacing the values of each variable:

    ```text
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=00000000000000000000
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<YOUR_REGION>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Have multiple sources of AWS credentials?">
  Teleport's AWS client loads credentials from different sources in the following
  order:

  - Environment Variables
  - Shared credentials file
  - Shared configuration file (Teleport always enables shared configuration)
  - EC2 Instance Metadata (credentials only)

  While you can provide AWS credentials via a shared credentials file or shared
  configuration file, you will need to run the Kubernetes and Discovery Services with the `AWS_PROFILE`
  environment variable assigned to the name of your profile of choice.

  If you have a specific use case that the instructions above do not account for,
  consult the documentation for the [AWS SDK for
  Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/) for a detailed
  description of credential loading behavior.
</Accordion>

Configure the Kubernetes and Discovery Services to start automatically when the host boots up by
creating a systemd service for it. The instructions depend on how you installed
the Kubernetes and Discovery Services.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Package Manager">
    On the host where you will run the Kubernetes and Discovery Services, enable and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TAR Archive">
    On the host where you will run the Kubernetes and Discovery Services, create a systemd service
    configuration for Teleport, enable the Teleport service, and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of the Kubernetes and Discovery Services with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

Once the Kubernetes and Discovery Services start, EKS clusters matching the tags
and regions specified in the AWS section will be added to the Teleport cluster
automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Discovery Service

To check if the Discovery Service is working correctly, you can check if any Kubernetes
clusters have been discovered. To do this, you can use the `tctl get kube_cluster`
command and inspect if the expected clusters have already been imported into Teleport.

If some clusters do not appear in the list, check if the filtering labels match
the missing cluster tags or look into the service logs for permission errors.

### Kubernetes Service

If the `tctl get kube_cluster` command returns the discovered clusters, but the
`tsh kube ls` command does not include them, check that you have set the
`kubernetes_service.resources` section correctly.

```yaml
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - tags:
      "env": "prod"
```

If the section is correctly configured, but clusters still do not appear or
return authentication errors, please check if permissions have been correctly configured
in your target cluster or that you have the correct permissions to list Kubernetes clusters
in Teleport.
