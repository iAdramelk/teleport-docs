title: Register a Kubernetes Cluster with a Static kubeconfig
description: Connecting standalone Teleport installations to Kubernetes clusters.
version: '13.x'
---

While you can register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport by running the
Teleport Kubernetes Service [on that cluster](/ver/13.x/kubernetes-access/getting-started), you can
also run the Teleport Kubernetes Service on a Linux host outside the cluster.
This is useful if you want to decouple your Teleport deployment from the
Kubernetes clusters you want to manage access to.

In this setup, the Teleport Kubernetes Service uses a `kubeconfig` file to
authenticate to the API server of your chosen Kubernetes cluster.

<Accordion title="Before you begin: read security tips">
  When running Teleport in production, we recommend that you follow the
  practices below to avoid security incidents. These practices may differ from
  the examples used in this guide, which are intended for demo environments:

  - Avoid using `sudo` in production environments unless it's necessary.
  - Create new, non-root, users and use test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  - Run Teleport's services as a non-root user unless required. Only the SSH
    Service requires root access. Note that you will need root permissions (or
    the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability) to make Teleport listen on a port
    numbered \< `1024` (e.g. `443`).
  - Follow the "Principle of Least Privilege" (PoLP). Don't give users
    permissive roles when giving them more restrictive roles will do instead.
    For example, don't assign users the built-in `access,editor` roles, which give
    them permissions to access and edit all cluster resources. Instead, define
    RBAC roles with the minimum required permissions for each user and configure
    Access Requests for elevated permissions.
  - When joining a Teleport resource service (e.g., the Database Service or
    Application Service) to a cluster, save the invitation token to a file.
    Otherwise, the token will be visible when examining the `teleport` command
    that started the agent, e.g., via the `history` command on a compromised
    system.

</Tabs>

- A Kubernetes cluster you would like to access.
- A Linux host deployed on your own infrastructure to run the Teleport
  Kubernetes Service. This can run outside of your Kubernetes cluster.
- The [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) command line
  tool installed on your workstation.
- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/4. Generate a kubeconfig file

The Teleport Kubernetes Service uses a `kubeconfig` file to authenticate to your
Kubernetes cluster. In this section, we will generate a `kubeconfig` file so we
can configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service to use it later in this guide.

### Ensure your context is correct

First, configure your local `kubectl` command to point at the Kubernetes cluster
you want to register. You can use the following command to verify that
the correct cluster is selected:

```code
$ kubectl config get-contexts
```

Use this command to switch to the cluster assigned to `CONTEXT_NAME`:

```code
# e.g., my-context
$ CONTEXT_NAME=context-name
$ kubectl config use-context ${CONTEXT_NAME?}
```

### Run the script

On your workstation, download Teleport's `get-kubeconfig.sh` script, which you
will use to generate the `kubeconfig` file:

```code
$ curl -OL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/v13.2.0/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh
```

`get-kubeconfig.sh` creates a service account for the Teleport Kubernetes
Service that can get Kubernetes pods as well as impersonate users, groups, and
other service accounts. The Teleport Kubernetes Service uses this service
account to manage access to resources in your Kubernetes cluster. The script
also ensures that there is a Kubernetes `Secret` in your cluster to store
service account credentials.

`get-kubeconfig.sh` also creates a namespace called `teleport` for the
resources it deploys, though you can choose a different name by assigning the
`TELEPORT_NAMESPACE` environment variable in the shell where you run the
script.

After creating resources, `get-kubeconfig.sh` writes a new `kubeconfig` file
called `kubeconfig` in the directory where you run the script.

Run the `get-kubeconfig.sh` script:

```code
$ bash get-kubeconfig.sh
```

The script is successful if you see this message:

```text
Done!
```

Move the `kubeconfig` file to the host you are using to run the Teleport
Kubernetes Service. We will assume that the `kubeconfig` file exists at
`/var/lib/teleport/kubeconfig`.

<Accordion title="Connecting multiple Kubernetes clusters?">
  You can connect multiple Kubernetes clusters to Teleport from one `kubeconfig`
  file if it contains multiple entries. Use
  [merge-kubeconfigs.sh](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/merge-kubeconfigs.sh)
  to combine multiple `kubeconfig` files generated by `get-kubeconfig.sh`.
</Accordion>

## Step 2/4. Set up the Teleport Kubernetes Service

In this step, you will install the Teleport Kubernetes Service and configure it
to use the `kubeconfig` file you generated to access a Kubernetes cluster.

### Get a join token

Establish trust between your Teleport cluster and your new Kubernetes Service
instance by creating a join token:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=kube --format=text --ttl=1h
abcd123-insecure-do-not-use-this
```

On the host where you are running the Teleport Kubernetes Service, create a
file called `/tmp/token` that consists only of your token:

```code
$ echo join-token | sudo tee /tmp/token
```

### Install the Teleport Kubernetes Service

Run the following commands on the host where you will install the Teleport
Kubernetes Service:

Use the appropriate commands for your environment to install your package:

    <Accordion title="Is my Teleport instance compatible with Teleport Cloud?">
      Before installing a `teleport` binary with a version besides v13,
      read our compatibility rules to ensure that the binary is compatible with
      Teleport Cloud.

      When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
      apply:

      - **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
        component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
        with any 8.3.0 component.
      - Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
        clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
        is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
        guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
        This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
        You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
      - Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
        an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
        default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
        when starting Proxy Services and resource services.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service

On the host where you will run the Teleport Kubernetes Service, create a file at
`/etc/teleport.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "teleport.example.com:3080"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  kubeconfig_file: "/var/lib/teleport/kubeconfig"
  labels:
    "region": "us-east1"
```

Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to replace `teleport.example.com:3080` with the host
and port of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Cloud tenant, e.g.,
`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

<Warning>
  When using `kubeconfig_file`, Amazon EKS users may need to replace illegal
  characters in the `context` names. Supported characters are alphanumeric
  characters, `.`, `_`, and `-`. EKS typically includes `:` and `@` in their
  `kubeconfig` files, which are not allowed in Teleport.
</Warning>

### Start the Teleport Kubernetes Service

Configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service to start automatically when the host boots up by
creating a systemd service for it. The instructions depend on how you installed
the Teleport Kubernetes Service.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Package Manager">
    On the host where you will run the Teleport Kubernetes Service, enable and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TAR Archive">
    On the host where you will run the Teleport Kubernetes Service, create a systemd service
    configuration for Teleport, enable the Teleport service, and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of the Teleport Kubernetes Service with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

## Step 3/4. Grant access to your Teleport user

Enable your Teleport user to access resources in your Kubernetes cluster so you
can connect to the cluster later in this guide.

### Kubernetes authentication

To authenticate to a Kubernetes cluster via Teleport, your Teleport roles must
allow access as at least one Kubernetes user or group. Ensure that you have a
Teleport role that grants access to the cluster you plan to interact with.

Run the following command to get the Kubernetes user for your current context:

```code
$ kubectl config view \
-o jsonpath="{.contexts[?(@.name==\"$(kubectl config current-context)\")].context.user}"
```

Create a file called `kube-access.yaml` with the following content, replacing
`USER` with the output of the command above.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v6
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "*"
        name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
    - viewers
    kubernetes_users:
    # Replace USER with the Kubernetes user for your current context.
    - USER
  deny: {}
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f kube-access.yaml
```

Assign the `kube-access` role to your Teleport user by running the following
commands, depending on whether you authenticate as a local Teleport user or via
the `github`, `saml`, or `oidc` authentication connectors:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local User">
    Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
    ```

    Edit `out.yaml`, adding `kube-access` to the list of existing roles:

    ```diff
      roles:
       - access
       - auditor
       - editor
    +  - kube-access
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f out.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    Retrieve your `github`  configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
    ```

    Edit `github.yaml`, adding `kube-access` to the
    `teams_to_roles` section. The team you will map to this role will depend on how
    you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest team
    possible within your organization. This team must also include your user.

    Here is an example:

    ```diff
      teams_to_roles:
        - organization: octocats
          team: admins
          roles:
            - access
    +       - kube-access
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f github.yaml
    ```

    <Warning>
      Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
      `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `github.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
      so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML">
    Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
    ```

    Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `kube-access` to the
    `attributes_to_roles` section. The attribute you will map to this role will
    depend on how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the
    smallest group possible within your organization. This group must also include
    your user.

    Here is an example:

    ```diff
      attributes_to_roles:
        - name: "groups"
          value: "my-group"
          roles:
            - access
    +       - kube-access
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
    ```

    <Warning>
      Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
      `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `saml.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
      so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
    </Warning>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
    ```

    Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `kube-access` to the
    `claims_to_roles` section. The claim you will map to this role will depend on
    how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest
    group possible within your organization. This group must also include your
    user.

    Here is an example:

    ```diff
      claims_to_roles:
        - name: "groups"
          value: "my-group"
          roles:
            - access
    +       - kube-access
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
    ```

    <Warning>
      Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
      `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `oidc.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,

Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again to assume the new role.

Now that Teleport RBAC is configured, you can authenticate to your Kubernetes
cluster via Teleport. To interact with your Kubernetes cluster, you will need to
configure authorization within Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes authorization

To configure authorization within your Kubernetes cluster, you need to create Kubernetes `RoleBinding`s or
`ClusterRoleBindings` that grant permissions to the subjects listed in `kubernetes_users` and
`kubernetes_groups`.

For example, you can grant some limited read-only permissions to the `viewers` group used in the `kube-access`
role defined above:

Create a file called `viewers-bind.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: viewers-crb
subjects:
- kind: Group
  # Bind the group "viewers", corresponding to the kubernetes_groups we assigned our "kube-access" role above
  name: viewers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  # "view" is a default ClusterRole that grants read-only access to resources
  # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles
  name: view
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the `ClusterRoleBinding` with `kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f viewers-bind.yaml
```

Log out of Teleport and log in again.

## Step 4/4. Access your Kubernetes cluster

After Teleport starts with the above config, you should be able to see all new
clusters:

```code
$ tsh kube ls
Kube Cluster Name                       Labels           Selected
--------------------------------------- ------           --------
my-cluster                              region=us-east-1
```

To access your cluster, run the following command, replacing `my-cluster` with
the name of the cluster you would like to access:

```code
$ tsh kube login my-cluster
Logged into kubernetes cluster "my-cluster". Try 'kubectl version' to test the connection.
```
