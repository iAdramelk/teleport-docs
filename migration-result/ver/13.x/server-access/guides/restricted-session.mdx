With a Restricted Session, Teleport allows the administrator to specify a policy to
apply to SSH sessions. This policy can restrict access to certain resources. Currently
Teleport supports network restrictions with more types coming in the future.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open Source">
    - A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our
      [Getting Started](/ver/13.x/index) guide.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```

      See [Installation](/ver/13.x/installation) for details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0,
      which you can download by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Linux kernel 5.8 (or above).

  You can check your kernel version using the `uname` command. The output should look
  something like the following.

  ```code
  $ uname -r
  # 5.8.17
  ```

### Linux distributions and supported kernels

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><td>Distro name</td><td>Distro version</td><td>Kernel version</td></tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Ubuntu "Groovy Gorilla"</td><td>20.10</td><td>5.8+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fedora</td><td>33</td><td>5.8+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Archlinux</td><td>2020.09.01</td><td>5.8.5+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Flatcar</td><td>2765.2.2</td><td>5.10.25+</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Network Restrictions

Network restrictions work similarly to a firewall but with several differences:

1. Firewall rules apply to the entire machine whereas network restrictions are applied
   only to SSH sessions.
2. Whereas firewall typically blocks ingress (inbound) connections, network restrictions
   block egress (outbound) connections.
3. Firewall rules are typically static but Teleport provides an API for
   Restricted Sessions that allows the rules to be dynamically updated across
   the entire fleet.

## Step 1/4. Install and configure a Teleport Node

Set up your Teleport Node with the following content in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

<Warning>
  Restricted Sessions require Enhanced Recording to be enabled. This
  requirement will be removed in the future.
</Warning>

```yaml
# Example config to be saved as /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: graviton-node
  auth_token: exampletoken
  # Replace with the address of the Teleport Auth Server.
  auth_server: 127.0.0.1:3025
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
auth_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  enhanced_recording:
    # Must be enabled for Restricted Sessions to work.
    enabled: true
    # Optional: Controls where cgroupv2 hierarchy is mounted. Default value:
    # /cgroup2.
    cgroup_path: /cgroup2

  restricted_session:
    enabled: true
```

## Step 2/4. Define a network restrictions policy

Create a file called `netpolicy.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: network_restrictions
version: v4
metadata:
  name: network-restrictions
spec:
  # When Restricted Sessions are enabled, the network policy becomes
  # "deny-all". Must add back the ranges to allow
  allow:
    # Allow LAN access
    - cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
    - cidr: 172.16.0.0/12
    - cidr: 192.168.0.0/16

    # Allow link-local
    - cidr: 169.254.0.0/16
    - cidr: fe80::/10

    # Allow localhost
    - cidr: 127.0.0.0/8
    - cidr: ::1/128

  # Override "allow" list with exceptions
  deny:
    # Finance database
    - cidr: 10.1.2.4
```

Install the policy using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f netpolicy.yaml
# network restrictions have been updated
```

If Restricted Sessions are not enabled in `teleport.yaml`, all network
operations will be allowed. When Restricted Sessions are enabled but a
`network_restrictions` object has not been created via `tctl` or the API, the
default policy stays allow-all.

However when the `network_restrictions` object is created, the default policy
switches to deny-all. If you expect network operations to target certain
IP ranges, be sure to state these within the `allow` section.

## Step 3/4. Test Restricted Sessions

```code
$ curl -v https://google.com
# *   Trying 2607:f8b0:4005:809::200e:80...
# * TCP_NODELAY set
# * Immediate connect fail for 2607:f8b0:4005:809::200e: Operation not permitted
# *   Trying 172.217.6.78:80...
# * TCP_NODELAY set
# * Immediate connect fail for 172.217.6.78: Operation not permitted
# * Closing connection 0
# curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server
```

## Step 4/4. Inspect logs

The Teleport audit log will contain an entry with a `session.network` event (there may be
more entries present for the same `curl` command):

```json
{
  "ei": 173,
  "event": "session.network",
  "uid": "dda39eb4-13e1-45fd-a039-35b4dca1fa51",
  "code": "T4002I",
  "time": "2021-07-22T22:24:14.984Z",
  "cluster_name": "teleport-quickstart",
  "user": "demo",
  "login": "demo",
  "sid": "c8e0b0d5-3994-4221-b701-c1ae17d871f1",
  "namespace": "default",
  "server_id": "4951c001-8dad-4e21-abb6-c03f69b72d2e",
  "pid": 319267,
  "cgroup_id": 10863,
  "program": "curl",
  "src_addr": "0.0.0.0",
  "dst_addr": "216.58.194.206",
  "dst_port": 80,
  "version": 4,
  "operation": 0,
  "action": 1
}
```

This is the same event that is issued by Enhanced Recording. You can differentiate them by the `action` field.
Enhanced Recording sets the `action` to `0` (`OBSERVED`) while a Restricted Session sets this value to `1` (`DENIED`).

<Tip>
  To quickly check the status of the audit log, you can simply tail the logs with
  `tail -f /var/lib/teleport/log/events.log`, the resulting capture from Teleport will
  be a JSON log for each command and network request.
</Tip>
