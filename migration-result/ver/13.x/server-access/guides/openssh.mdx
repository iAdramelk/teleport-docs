In this guide, we will show you how to configure the OpenSSH server `sshd` to
join a Teleport cluster. Existing fleets of OpenSSH servers can be configured to
accept SSH certificates dynamically issued by a Teleport CA.

Using Teleport and OpenSSH has the advantage of getting you up
and running, but in the long run, we would recommend replacing `sshd` with `teleport`.
`teleport` SSH servers have support for multiple features that are incompatible with OpenSSH:

- RBAC and resource filtering based on [dynamically updated labels](/ver/13.x/management/admin/labels)
- [Session recording without SSH connection termination](/ver/13.x/server-access/guides/recording-proxy-mode)
- [Advanced session recording](/ver/13.x/server-access/guides/bpf-session-recording)
- [Restricting outbound network connections in SSH sessions](/ver/13.x/server-access/guides/restricted-session)

Teleport supports OpenSSH by proxying SSH connections through the Proxy Service. When a Teleport user requests to connect to an OpenSSH node, the Proxy Service checks the user's Teleport roles.

If the RBAC checks succeed, the Proxy Service authenticates to the OpenSSH node with a dynamically generated certificate signed by a Teleport CA. This allows the
Proxy Service to record and audit connections to OpenSSH nodes.

The Proxy Service prevents Teleport users from bypassing auditing by requiring
a certificate signed by a Teleport CA that only the Auth Service possesses.

In this setup, the Teleport SSH Service performs RBAC checks as well as audits and records sessions on its host, which eliminates the need for connection termination when recording SSH sessions.

- A Linux host with the OpenSSH server `sshd` version 7.4 or above installed,
  but not Teleport. The SSH port on this host must be open to traffic from the
  Teleport Proxy Service host.
- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/3. Configure `sshd`

Teleport only allows access to resources in your infrastructure via Teleport
processes that that have joined the cluster.

To register the OpenSSH node, you must have a valid auth token to connect to the cluster.
You can generate the token by running the following command against your Teleport Auth Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=node --format=text
abcd123-insecure-do-not-use-this
```

Copy the `teleport` binary to your `sshd` host. Configure `sshd` and create a node
resource on your cluster with the following command:

```code
$ sudo teleport join openssh \
  --address server1.example.com:22 \
  --proxy-server teleport.example.com:443 \
  --join-method token \
  --token token \
  --labels env=dev
```

Change the command-line options to assign the following values:

- Set to the address and port of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- Set to the address and port of the node that will join the cluster.
- Set to the token value.

Check that your new node is listed with `tsh ls` or in the Web UI.  You can edit the
hostname and labels with `tctl edit nodes/<hostname>`.  If the hostname isn't unique get the UUID
from `tctl nodes ls -v` and edit with `tctl edit nodes/<uuid>`.

## Step 2/3. Generate an SSH client configuration

The next step is to configure your OpenSSH client to connect to your `sshd` host
using credentials managed by Teleport. This configuration will use your user's
Teleport-issued certificate to authenticate to the `sshd` host. It will also
authenticate the `sshd` host using the host certificate you generated earlier.

First, make sure you have logged in to your Teleport cluster:

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor, host-certifier
  Logins:             ubuntu, root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-05-06 22:54:01 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h53m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor, reviewer, host-certifier
  Logins:             ubuntu, root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-05-06 22:54:01 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h53m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor, reviewer, host-certifier
  Logins:             ubuntu, root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-05-06 22:54:01 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h53m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

On your local machine, run the following `tsh` command. This will print a
configuration block that tells your SSH client to use credentials managed by
Teleport to connect to hosts in your cluster.

```code
$ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
```

This command creates an SSH configuration file at a nonstandard location in
order to make it easier to clean up, but you can append the output of
`tsh config` to the default SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) if you wish.

<Accordion title="How does the config work?">
  Teleport implements an SSH server that includes several **subsystems**, or
  predefined commands that are run when the server handles a connection. The Proxy
  Service implements a `proxy` subsystem that forwards SSH traffic to remote hosts
  and Trusted Clusters.

  Here is a brief explanation of the configuration that `tsh config` generates:

  ```
  # Common flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts
  Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} {{ .ProxyHost }}
      UserKnownHostsFile "{{ .KnownHostsPath }}"
      IdentityFile "{{ .IdentityFilePath }}"
      CertificateFile "{{ .CertificateFilePath }}"
  ```

  If the host you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster (i.e., its
  address is a subdomain of your cluster's domain), use a Teleport-managed known
  hosts file, private key, and certificate that are stored in the `.tsh`
  directory.

  ```
  # Flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts except the proxy
  Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} !{{ .ProxyHost }}
      Port 3022
      ProxyCommand "{{ .TSHPath }}" proxy ssh --cluster={{ .ClusterName }} --proxy={{ .ProxyHost }} %r@%h:%p
  ```

  If the host that you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster, the
  OpenSSH client will first execute a command, the `ProxyCommand`, that
  establishes an SSH connection to the Proxy Service. This command,
  `tsh proxy ssh`, requests the `proxy` subsystem in order to forward SSH traffic
  through the Proxy Service to your chosen host (including a host in a Trusted
  Cluster).

  The `tsh proxy ssh` command requests the `proxy` subsystem through a command
  similar to the following, which assumes you are logging in to a node called
  `mynode` as `root` with a cluster called `teleport.example.com`:

  ```code
  $ /usr/bin/ssh -l root -A -o UserKnownHostsFile=/root/.tsh/known_hosts -p 11105 teleport.example.com -s proxy:mynode:3022@teleport.example.com
  ```

  Notice that the `known_hosts` file used by the command is managed by `tsh`.
  Since the `sshd` host's information is listed in this file, your SSH client can
  authenticate the host via the certificate we generated earlier.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using PowerShell on Windows?">
  If using PowerShell on Windows, note that normal shell redirection may write
  the file with the incorrect encoding. To ensure it's written properly, try the
  following:

  ```code
  $ tsh.exe config | out-file .ssh\config -encoding utf8 -append
  ```
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  If you switch between multiple Teleport Proxy Servers, you'll need to re-run
  `tsh config` for each to generate the cluster-specific configuration.

  Similarly, if Trusted Clusters are added or removed, be sure to re-run
  `tsh config` and replace the previous configuration.
</Tip>

## Step 3/3. Connect to your `sshd` host

Once you have appended the new text to your OpenSSH client configuration file,
you can log in to your `sshd` host using the configuration we generated earlier.

First, define environment variables for the address of your Teleport cluster,
the username you will use to log in to your `sshd` host, and the port on your
`sshd` host you are using for SSH traffic:

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=teleport.example.com
$ PORT=22
```

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=mytenant.teleport.sh
$ PORT=22
```

Next, SSH in to your remote host:

```code
$ ssh -p ${PORT?} -F ssh_config_teleport "${USER?}@${ADDR?}.${CLUSTER?}"
```

This name does not need to be resolvable via DNS as the connection will be
routed through your Teleport Proxy Service.

<Accordion title="Why are we overriding the port here?">
  By default, the OpenSSH client configuration generated by `tsh config` directs
  the Teleport Proxy Service to dial port 3022 of a node in your Teleport cluster.
  This works if the node's SSH Service is listening on port 3022, and means that
  you can connect to the Teleport SSH Service via your OpenSSH client.

  When you join a Teleport node to a cluster, the node creates a reverse tunnel
  to the cluster's Proxy Service. When you run an `ssh` command to access a host
  in your Teleport cluster using the configuration we generated, the Teleport
  Proxy Service will attempt to connect to the host via this reverse tunnel and,
  if that fails, try directly dialing the address.

  In our case, the `sshd` host is not running Teleport, so no reverse tunnel will
  exist. Instead, the Proxy Service will establish a direct connection on the
  host's SSH port.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using Trusted Clusters?">
  You can log in to a host in a Trusted Cluster by placing the name of the cluster
  between the name of the node and the name of your root Teleport cluster:

  ```code
  $ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport ${USER?}@node2.leafcluster.${CLUSTER}
  ```
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Teleport uses OpenSSH certificates instead of keys. When you connect to a
  remote host, OpenSSH verifies that the address of the host is listed under the
  `Principals` section of the OpenSSH certificate. Usually, this is a fully
  qualified domain name, rather than an IP address.
</Tip>

## Revoke an SSH certificate

Teleport's approach to using short-lived certificates for all infrastructure
access means that it can generate large numbers of certificates every day. For
this reason, Teleport does not support traditional certificate revocation.

There are two options available for revoking access: CA rotations, and Teleport locks.

### CA Rotations

To generate a new certificate authority and invalidate user certificates issued
by the current CA, run `tctl auth rotate --type-user`. This process will require
that the newly generated CA certificate is uploaded to your entire fleet of
OpenSSH servers. This can be a disruptive change, especially in environments
that lack automation, so proceed with caution.

### Locks

Teleport locks allow you to permanently or temporarily revoke access to a number
of different "targets". Supported lock targets include: specific users, roles,
servers, desktops, or MFA devices. When a lock is created any existing sessions
where the lock applies will be terminated, and new sessions will be rejected while
the lock remains in force.

For more information, read our
[Session and Identity Locking Guide](/ver/13.x/access-controls/guides/locking).
