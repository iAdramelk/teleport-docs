The following `tctl` commands are used to manage the Teleport Windows Desktop
Service.

- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

Generate a join token for a Windows Desktop Service:

```sh
$ tctl tokens add --type=WindowsDesktop
```

List registered Windows Desktop Services:

```sh
$ tctl get windows_desktop_service
```

List registered Windows desktops:

```sh
$ tctl get windows_desktop
```
