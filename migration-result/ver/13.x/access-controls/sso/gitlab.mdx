description: How to configure Teleport access using GitLab for SSO
h1: Teleport SSO Authentication with GitLab
version: '13.x'
---

This guide will cover how to configure [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/) to issue
credentials to specific groups of users. When used in combination with role
based access control (RBAC), it allows administrators to define policies
like:

- Only members of the "DBA" group can access PostgreSQL databases.
- Only members of "ProductionKubernetes" can access production Kubernetes clusters
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

## Prerequisites

- At least two groups in GitLab with users assigned. In our examples below,
  we'll assume a group named `company` with two subgroups, `admin` and `dev`.
- Teleport role with access to maintaining `oidc` resources.  This is available
  in the default `editor` role.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster, including the Auth Service and Proxy Service. For
      details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise [Getting
      Started](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0,
      which you can download by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Configure GitLab

You should have at least one group configured in GitLab to map to Teleport roles.
In this example we use the names `gitlab-dev` and `gitlab-admin`.  Assign users
to each of these groups.

1. Create an application in one of your groups (**Group overview** ->
   **Settings** -> **Applications**) that will allow using GitLab as an OAuth
   provider to Teleport.

   Settings:

   - Redirect URL: `https://<proxy url>/v1/webapi/oidc/callback`.
   - Check `Confidential`, `openid`, `profile`, and `email`.

   ![Create App](../../../../../assets/gitlab-oidc-0-bab5a886ec.png)

2. Collect the `Application ID` and `Secret` in the Application. These will be
   used in the Teleport OIDC auth connector:

   ![Collection Information](../../../../../assets/gitlab-oidc-1-ab9abbae38.png)

3. Confirm the GitLab issuer address.

   For GitLab.com, the issuer address is `https://gitlab.com`. This allows
   Teleport to access the Open-ID configuration at
   `https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`. If you are self
   hosting the issuer address is the path to your GitLab instance.

## Configure Teleport

### Create a OIDC Connector

Create an OIDC connector resource using `tctl`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitLab.com">
    Replace the application ID and secret with the values from GitLab:

    ```code
    $ tctl sso configure oidc --preset gitlab \
    --id <APPLICATION-ID> \
    --secret <APPLICATION-SECRET> \
    --claims-to-roles groups,company/admin,admin \
    --claims-to-roles groups,company/dev,dev > oidc.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
    Replace the application ID and secret with the values from GitLab, and replace
    `https://gitlab.company.com` with the path to your self-hosted GitLab instance:

    ```code
    $ tctl sso configure oidc --preset gitlab \
    --id <APPLICATION-ID> \
    --issuer-url https://gitlab.company.com \
    --secret <APPLICATION-SECRET> \
    --claims-to-roles groups,company/admin,admin \
    --claims-to-roles groups,company/dev,dev > oidc.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This example maps the two subgroups `admin` and `dev` of the parent group
`company` to the `admin` and `dev` roles in Teleport, and creates the `oidc.yaml` file:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: gitlab
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - admin
    value: company/admin
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - dev
    value: company/gitlab-dev
  client_id: <APPLICATION-ID>
  client_secret: <APPLICATION-SECRET>
  display: Gitlab
  issuer_url: https://gitlab.com
  prompt: none
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com:443/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
version: v3

```

Test the connector resource by piping the file to `tctl sso test`:

```code
$ cat oidc.yaml | tctl sso test
```

After authorizing the application in GitLab you should get a
**Login Successful** message in your web browser. Otherwise, consult the output
of the command to diagnose.

Create the connector using `tctl` tool:

```code
$ tctl create -f oidc.yaml.yaml
```

## Create Teleport Roles

We are going to create 2 roles, privileged role admin who is able to login as
root and is capable of administrating the cluster and non-privileged dev.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: admin
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [root]
    node_labels:
      "*": "*"
    rules:
      - resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"]
```

The developer role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [ "{{email.local(external.email)}}", ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      access: relaxed
```

- Devs are only allowed to login to nodes labelled with `access: relaxed` label.
- Developers can log in as `ubuntu` user
- Notice `{{external.email}}` login. It configures Teleport to look at
  *"email"* GitLab claim and use that field as an allowed login for each user.  The `email.local(external.trait)` function will remove the `@domain` and just have the username prefix.
- Developers also do not have any "allow rules" i.e. they will not be able to
  see/replay past sessions or re-configure the Teleport cluster.

Create both roles on the auth server:

```code
$ tctl create -f admin.yaml
$ tctl create -f dev.yaml
```

## Enable default OIDC authentication

Configure Teleport to use OIDC authentication as the default instead of the local
user database.

You can either edit your Teleport configuration file or create a dynamic
resource.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static Config (Self-Hosted)">
    Update `/etc/teleport.yaml` in the `auth_service` section and restart the `teleport` daemon.

    ```yaml
    auth_service:
      authentication:
        type: oidc

    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dynamic Resources (All Editions)">
    Create a file called `cap.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    kind: cluster_auth_preference
    metadata:
      name: cluster-auth-preference
    spec:    
      type: oidc
    version: v2
    ```

    Create a resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f cap.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with GitLab". The CLI is
the same as before:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=teleport.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

<Tip>
  Teleport can use multiple OIDC/SAML connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=connector_name`
</Tip>

<Note>
  Teleport only supports sending party initiated flows for OIDC Connect. This
  means you can not initiate login from your identity provider, you have to
  initiate login from either the Teleport Web UI or CLI.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting SSO configuration can be challenging. Usually a Teleport administrator
must be able to:

- Ensure that HTTP/TLS certificates are configured properly for both Teleport
  proxy and the SSO provider.

- Be able to see what SAML/OIDC claims and values are getting exported and passed
  by the SSO provider to Teleport.
- Be able to see how Teleport maps the received claims to role mappings as defined
  in the connector.

If something is not working, we recommend to:

- Double-check the host names, tokens and TCP ports in a connector definition.

### Using the Web UI

If you get "access denied" or other login errors, the number one place to check is the Audit
Log. Under the **Management** area you can access it within the **Activity** tab in the
Teleport Web UI.

![Audit Log Entry for SSO Login error](../../../../../assets/teleportauditlogssofailed-a5da7b0950.png)

Example of a user being denied because the role `clusteradmin` wasn't set up:

```json
{
  "code": "T1001W",
  "error": "role clusteradmin is not found",
  "event": "user.login",
  "method": "oidc",
  "success": false,
  "time": "2019-06-15T19:38:07Z",
  "uid": "cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"
}
```

### Teleport does not show the expected Nodes

When Teleport's Auth Service receives a request to list Teleport Nodes (e.g., to
display Nodes in the Web UI or via `tsh ls`), it only returns the Nodes that the
current user is authorized to view.

For each Node in the user's Teleport cluster, the Auth Service applies the
following checks in order and, if one check fails, hides the Node from the user:

- None of the user's roles contain a `deny` rule that matches the Node's labels.
- At least one of the user's roles contains an `allow` rule that matches the
  Node's labels.

If you are not seeing Nodes when expected, make sure that your user's roles
include the appropriate `allow` and `deny` rules as documented in the
[Teleport Access Controls Reference](/ver/13.x/access-controls/reference).

When configuring SSO, ensure that the identity provider is populating each user's
traits correctly. For a user to see a Node in Teleport, the result of populating a
template variable in a role's `allow.logins` must match at least one of a user's
`traits.logins`.

In this example a user will have usernames `ubuntu`, `debian` and usernames from the SSO trait `logins` for Nodes that have a `env: dev` label.  If the SSO trait username is `bob` then the usernames would include `ubuntu`, `debian`, and `bob`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['{{external.logins}}', ubuntu, debian]
    node_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
version: v5
```
