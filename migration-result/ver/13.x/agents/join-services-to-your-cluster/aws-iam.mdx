title: Joining Services via AWS IAM Role
description: Use the IAM join method to add services to your Teleport cluster on AWS
version: '13.x'
---

This guide will explain how to use the **IAM join method** to configure Teleport
processes to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets when they
are running in AWS.

The IAM join method is available to any Teleport process running anywhere with
access to IAM credentials, such as an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role.
No specific permissions or IAM policy is required: an IAM role with no attached
policies is sufficient. No IAM credentials are required on the Teleport Auth
Service.

Support for joining a cluster with the Proxy Service behind a layer 7 load
balancer or reverse proxy is available in Teleport 13.0+.

For other methods of joining a Teleport process to a cluster, see [Joining
Teleport Services to a Cluster](/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster).

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open Source">
    - A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our
      [Getting Started](/ver/13.x/index) guide.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```

      See [Installation](/ver/13.x/installation) for details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0,
      which you can download by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- An AWS EC2 instance to host a Teleport service, with the Teleport binary
  installed.

Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
remotely:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
$ tctl status
# Cluster  teleport.example.com
# Version  13.2.0
# CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
```

You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
$ tctl status
# Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
# Version  13.2.0
# CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
```

You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/4. Set up AWS IAM credentials

Every Teleport process using the IAM method to join your Teleport cluster needs
AWS IAM credentials in order to call the `sts:GetCallerIdentity` API. No
specific IAM policy or permissions are needed. Any IAM user or role can call
this API.

If running Teleport on an EC2 instance, it is sufficient to attach any IAM role
to the instance. To attach an IAM role from the EC2 dashboard, select `Actions >
Security > Modify IAM role`. It is not necessary for the role to have any
attached IAM policies at all. If your instance does not otherwise need AWS
credentials, it is preferred to create and attach an empty role with no attached
policies.

## Step 2/4. Create the AWS joining token

Under the hood, services will prove that they are running in your AWS account by
sending a pre-signed `sts:GetCallerIdentity` request to the Teleport Auth
Service. The service's identity must match an allow rule configured in your AWS
service joining token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your AWS
account and the ARN that the Teleport process's identity must match.

```
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: iam-token
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required (e.g. Node, App, Kube, DB, WindowsDesktop)
  roles: [Node]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: iam

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which Teleport processes may join from
  - aws_account: "111111111111"
  # multiple allow rules are supported
  - aws_account: "222222222222"
  # aws_arn is optional and allows you to restrict the IAM role of joining
  # Teleport processes
  - aws_account: "333333333333"
    aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::333333333333:assumed-role/teleport-node-role/i-*"
```

The token name `iam-token` is just an example and can be any value you want to
use, as long as you use the same value for `join_params.token_name` in Step 3.

The optional `aws_arn` field in the allow rules supports wildcard characters:

- `*` to match any combination of characters
- `?` to match any single character

Run the following command to create the token:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 3/4. Configure your services

The IAM join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, or Database Service.

Configure your Teleport service with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: iam` as shown in the following example config:

```
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: iam-token
    method: iam
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```

In the `teleport.proxy_server` field, replace the value with the host and web
port of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant, e.g.,
`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

## Step 4/4. Launch your Teleport process

Grant your Teleport instance access to credentials that it can use to authenticate to
AWS. If you are running your Teleport instance on an EC2 instance, you should use the EC2
Instance Metadata Service method. Otherwise, you must use environment variables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Instance Metadata Service">
    Teleport will detect when it is running on an EC2 instance and use the Instance
    Metadata Service to fetch credentials.

    The EC2 instance should be configured to use an EC2 instance profile. For more
    information, see: [Using Instance Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Environment Variables">
    Teleport's built-in AWS client reads credentials from the following environment
    variables:

    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

    When you start your Teleport instance, the service reads environment variables from a
    file at the path `/etc/default/teleport`. Obtain these credentials from your
    organization. Ensure that `/etc/default/teleport` has the following content,
    replacing the values of each variable:

    ```text
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=00000000000000000000
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<YOUR_REGION>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Have multiple sources of AWS credentials?">
  Teleport's AWS client loads credentials from different sources in the following
  order:

  - Environment Variables
  - Shared credentials file
  - Shared configuration file (Teleport always enables shared configuration)
  - EC2 Instance Metadata (credentials only)

  While you can provide AWS credentials via a shared credentials file or shared
  configuration file, you will need to run your Teleport instance with the `AWS_PROFILE`
  environment variable assigned to the name of your profile of choice.

  If you have a specific use case that the instructions above do not account for,
  consult the documentation for the [AWS SDK for
  Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/) for a detailed
  description of credential loading behavior.
</Accordion>

Configure your Teleport instance to start automatically when the host boots up by
creating a systemd service for it. The instructions depend on how you installed
your Teleport instance.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Package Manager">
    On the host where you will run your Teleport instance, enable and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TAR Archive">
    On the host where you will run your Teleport instance, create a systemd service
    configuration for Teleport, enable the Teleport service, and start Teleport:

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable teleport
    $ sudo systemctl start teleport
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can check the status of your Teleport instance with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

Once you have started Teleport, confirm that your service is able to connect to and
join your cluster.
