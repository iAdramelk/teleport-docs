title: Using Teleport's Certificate Authority with GitHub
description:  How to use Teleport's short-lived SSH certificates with the GitHub Certificate Authority.
version: '13.x'
---

Teleport supports exporting user SSH certificates with configurable key extensions. This allows the Teleport CA to be used in conjunction with GitHub's support for SSH Certificate Authorities. This way, users can access their organizations' repositories with short-lived, signed SSH certificates.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open Source">
    - A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our
      [Getting Started](/ver/13.x/index) guide.

    - The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```

      See [Installation](/ver/13.x/installation) for details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    - A running Teleport Enterprise cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
      [Getting Started](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction) guide.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0,
      which you can download by visiting your [Teleport account](https://teleport.sh).

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Teleport Cloud">
    - A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the [signup
      page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin a free trial of Teleport Team
      and upgrade to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

    - The Enterprise `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= 13.2.0.
      To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/downloads) page.

      ```code
      $ tctl version
      # Teleport Enterprise v13.2.0 go1.20

      $ tsh version
      # Teleport v13.2.0 go1.20
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- Access to GitHub Enterprise and permissions to modify GitHub's SSH Certificate Authorities.
- Make sure you can connect to Teleport. Log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl`
  remotely:
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  teleport.example.com
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678abdc1245efgh5678
  ```
  You can run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

  For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your Auth Service host.
  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh --user=email@example.com
  $ tctl status
  # Cluster  myinstance.teleport.sh
  # Version  13.2.0
  # CA pin   sha256:sha-hash-here
  ```
  You must run subsequent `tctl` commands in this guide on your local machine.

## Step 1/3. Import the Teleport CA into GitHub

In order to export the Teleport CA, execute the following command, assigning PROXY to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
$ curl 'https://proxy/webapi/auth/export?type=user' | sed 's/^cert-authority //g'
```

Next, follow the instructions in the guide below to import your Teleport CA into GitHub:

[Managing your organization's SSH certificate authorities](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities)

The contents of the exported `teleport.ca` file should by pasted into the "Key" field after clicking "New CA".

## Step 2/3. Configure the GitHub key extension

Create or update a role to include the `cert_extensions` option. The value of `name` must be `login@github.com`.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  options:
     cert_extensions:
       - type: ssh
         mode: extension
         name: login@github.com # required to be `login@github.com`.
         value: "{{ external.logins }}"
```

Assign the `developer` role to your Teleport user by running the following
commands, depending on whether you authenticate as a local Teleport user or via
the `github`, `saml`, or `oidc` authentication connectors:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local User">
    Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
    ```

    Edit `out.yaml`, adding `developer` to the list of existing roles:

    ```diff
      roles:
       - access
       - auditor
       - editor
    +  - developer
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f out.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    Retrieve your `github`  configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
    ```

    Edit `github.yaml`, adding `developer` to the
    `teams_to_roles` section. The team you will map to this role will depend on how
    you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest team
    possible within your organization. This team must also include your user.

    Here is an example:

    ```diff
      teams_to_roles:
        - organization: octocats
          team: admins
          roles:
            - access
    +       - developer
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f github.yaml
    ```

    <Warning>
      Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
      `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `github.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
      so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML">
    Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
    ```

    Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `developer` to the
    `attributes_to_roles` section. The attribute you will map to this role will
    depend on how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the
    smallest group possible within your organization. This group must also include
    your user.

    Here is an example:

    ```diff
      attributes_to_roles:
        - name: "groups"
          value: "my-group"
          roles:
            - access
    +       - developer
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
    ```

    <Warning>
      Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
      `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `saml.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
      so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OIDC">
    Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

    ```code
    $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
    ```

    Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `developer` to the
    `claims_to_roles` section. The claim you will map to this role will depend on
    how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest
    group possible within your organization. This group must also include your
    user.

    Here is an example:

    ```diff
      claims_to_roles:
        - name: "groups"
          value: "my-group"
          roles:
            - access
    +       - developer
    ```

    Apply your changes:

    ```code
    $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
    ```

    <Warning>
      Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
      `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `oidc.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
      so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again to assume the new role.

## Step 3/3. Issue a user certificate

A user certificate may be issued with the following command, where `<USERNAME>` is the Teleport user to generate the SSH certificate for:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --out out.cer --user=<USERNAME>
```

To test that authentication with this signed certificate is working correctly, SSH into `github.com` with your organization's user:

```code
$ ssh -i out.cer org-<ID>@github.com
```

If authentication is successful,  a "You've successfully authenticated" message should be displayed in the terminal.

This newly generated certificate may then be used when interacting with GitHub over SSH by adding the following to the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```code
Host github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile path/to/out.cer
```

When using SSH Certificate Authorities, you should retrieve your GitHub repository's SSH URL from the GitHub UI so the correct SSH user is used for authentication. For more information, see [About SSH URLs with SSH certificates](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/about-ssh-certificate-authorities#about-ssh-urls-with-ssh-certificates).
