## Can I use Teleport in production today?

Teleport has been deployed on server clusters with thousands of hosts at
Fortune 500 companies. It has been through several security audits from
nationally recognized technology security companies, so we are comfortable with
the stability of Teleport from a security perspective.

## Can Teleport be deployed in agentless mode?

Yes. All Teleport services support agentless mode, where the service proxies
traffic to an upstream infrastructure resource not available on `localhost`.

With Teleport in agentless mode, you can easily control access to SSH servers,
Kubernetes clusters, desktops, databases, and internal applications without
running any additional software on your servers. Agentless mode supports session
recordings and audit logs for deep understanding into user behavior.

For capabilities such as kernel-level logging and user provisioning, we
recommend Teleport as a drop in replacement for OpenSSH. Since Teleport replaces
the OpenSSH agent while preserving OpenSSH's functionality, you get more
functionality without a net addition of an agent on your system.

## Can I use OpenSSH with a Teleport cluster?

Yes, this question comes up often and is related to the previous one. Take a
look at [Using OpenSSH Guide](/ver/13.x/server-access/guides/openssh).

## Can I connect to Nodes behind a firewall?

Yes, Teleport supports reverse SSH tunnels out of the box. To configure
behind-firewall clusters refer to our
[Trusted Clusters](/ver/13.x/management/admin/trustedclusters) guide.

## Can individual agents create reverse tunnels to the Proxy Service without creating a new cluster?

Yes. When running a Teleport agent, use the `--auth-server` flag to point to the
Proxy Service address (this would be `public_addr` and `web_listen_addr` in your
file configuration). For more information, see
[Adding Nodes to the
Cluster](/ver/13.x/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token).

## Can Nodes use a single port for reverse tunnels?

Yes, Teleport supports tunnel multiplexing on a single port. Set the
`tunnel_listen_addr` to use the same port as the `web_listen_addr` address
setting in the `proxy_service` configuration. Teleport will automatically use
multiplexing with that configuration.

## Can I copy files from one Teleport node to another?

Yes, Teleport supports [Headless WebAuthn authentication](/ver/13.x/access-controls/guides/headless),
which allows you to perform operations like `tsh ssh` or `tsh scp` from remote systems where you
are not logged in to Teleport or may not have access to a browser.

## I'm getting `ssh: subsystem request failed` while I try to copy files, what to do?

Make sure that all Teleport components are at least at version 10.3.0. Older versions
don't support the SFTP protocol, and it's enabled by default in `tsh` v11.0.0 and OpenSSH v9.0.

## How is Open Source different from Enterprise?

Teleport provides four editions:

- Teleport Team
- Teleport Enterprise
- Teleport Enterprise Cloud
- Teleport Community Edition

Here is a detailed breakdown of the differences between Teleport's editions.

## Which version of Teleport is supported?

Teleport provides security-critical support for the current and two previous
releases. With our typical release cadence, this means a release is usually
supported for 9 months.

### Supported versions

Here are the major versions of Teleport and their support windows:

| Release | Release Date     | EOL           | Minimum `tsh` version |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| v13.0   | May 8, 2023      | February 2024 | v12.x.x               |
| v12.0   | Feb 6, 2023      | November 2023 | v11.x.x               |
| v11.0   | October 24, 2022 | July 2023     | v10.x.x               |

See our [Upgrading](/ver/13.x/management/operations/upgrading) guide for more
information.

### Version compatibility

When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
apply:

- **Patch and minor** versions are always compatible, for example, any 8.0.1
  component will work with any 8.0.3 component and any 8.1.0 component will work
  with any 8.3.0 component.
- Servers support clients that are 1 major version behind, but do not support
  clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
  is compatible with 7.x.x resource services and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
  guarantee that a 9.x.x resource service will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service.
  This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
  You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
- Proxy Services and resource services do not support Auth Services that are on
  an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Services by
  default. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--skip-version-check`
  when starting Proxy Services and resource services.

## Does the Web UI support copy and paste?

Yes. You can copy and paste using a mouse.

## What TCP ports does Teleport use?

Please refer to our [Networking](/ver/13.x/reference/networking) guide.

## Does Teleport support authentication via OAuth, SAML, or Active Directory?

Teleport offers this feature for the [Enterprise versions of Teleport](/ver/13.x/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/introduction).

## Why do I see an alert that some agents are out of date?

Teleport monitors the inventory of all cluster components and compares their
Teleport versions with the latest release on our GitHub page. If a component is
not on the latest release, Teleport will create a cluster alert encouraging
users to upgrade.

This check is performed against all cluster components, including the Proxy
Service and Auth Service, as well as agents running other Teleport Services.

## Can I suppress warnings about available upgrades?

Yes. The `tctl alerts ack` command can be used to acknowledge an alert and
temporarily prevent it from being displayed to users. To acknowledge an alert,
you need its ID. You can get a listing of all alerts and their IDs with the
`tctl alerts list` command.

For detailed information on this family of commands, see the
[CLI Reference](/ver/13.x/reference/cli#tctl-alerts-list).

## Does Teleport send any data back to the cloud?

The open source edition of Teleport does not send any information to our
company, and can be used on servers without internet access.

The commercial editions of Teleport can optionally be configured to send
anonymized information, depending on the license purchased. This information
contains the following:

- Teleport license identifier;
- anonymized cluster name and Teleport auth server host ID;
- for each Teleport user, the anonymized user name and a per-protocol count of
  interactions - Teleport logins, SSH and Kubernetes exec sessions, Application
  access web sessions and TCP connections, SSH port forwards, Kubernetes API
  requests, SFTP actions.

The anonymization is done by passing names and IDs through HMAC-SHA-256, with a
HMAC key that's randomly generated when the Teleport cluster is initialized for
the first time and is never shared with us; this makes it infeasible for anyone
without access to the cluster to deanonymize the data we store.

The code that aggregates and anonymizes this data can be found [in our
repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/lib/usagereporter/teleport/aggregating).

### Teleport Connect

When you first start the app, Teleport Connect asks for permission to collect and send telemetry data.
This includes tracking events such as:

- Logging in to a cluster
- Starting an SSH, database, or Kubernetes session
- File transfer during an SSH session
- Creating an Access Request
- Reviewing an Access Request
- Assuming an Access Request

On login, we also collect some device-related data:

- Operating system and its version
- App version
- Processor architecture

Additionally, we ask for a job role (answer is optional).

The full list of events and collected data is defined as [protocol buffer messages in the Teleport source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v13/proto/prehog/v1alpha/connect.proto).
We do not track the details of those events but merely that the given event took place. Each event includes the cluster
name and user name anonymized with HMAC using the cluster's internal random UUID as the key. It is infeasible to
associate this back to a specific cluster or user without access to the cluster's internal datastore.

If you no longer want to send usage data, see [disabling telemetry](/ver/13.x/connect-your-client/teleport-connect#disabling-telemetry).
